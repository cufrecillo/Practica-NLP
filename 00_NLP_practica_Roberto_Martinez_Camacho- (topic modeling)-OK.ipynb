However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in. The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for. In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk. For a while I wasn't sure what was giving him horrible gas, so I started to track what I ate in case it was a food allergy (we have a peanut allergy in the family). We even write notes about his first smile, who came to visit, ect to keep in his memory box.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"My wife and I have a six month old baby boy and around the 4-month mark my wife decided that she would return to work instead of being a stay-at-home mom. We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones. The legibility in the Baby Tracker is a huge improvement over our standard notebook entries that really ended up becoming small paragraphs. In a few short moments you can summarize all of the data in the columns in the totals section and determine key information - how much did baby eat, did baby have a bowel movement, how much sleep did they get, etc.There are, however, some frustrating limitations with this journal. First the entire layout is about half a notebook sheet divided down the middle (portrait layout). This constrains entries to very small spaces on each column and row. For much of the information that is okay - feedings can be summarized in ounces; diaper changes by a &#34;#1 or #2&#34; and so on. However, once your baby becomes more active and you'd like to know more than &#34;tummy time&#34; under the play-time column things start to get very tight on the page.Another problem is that this tracker only covers 12 hours out of a baby's day. That's fine if the intention is only to track hours while a baby is with child care providers. However, we really wanted to track our little boy's entire day which often starts much earlier than 6am. Using this journal that would require the use of a second page.--------------------WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(+) Good layout that is easy to read and instantly gather information about your baby's day in a matter of moments(+) High quality paper(+) Consistent quality between the pages--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(-) Expensive and gets you at most 6-months, less if you use more than one page for tracking your babies entire day(-) The cover is thick but not a hardback and bends easily in a diaper bag(-) The pages should really be bigger. I understand portability is a concern but the current size is entirely too small--------------------CONCLUSION:I ended up making my own format of this journal in a spreadsheet that includes a 24-hour day and more space for comments along with a few other changes and had the pages bound cheaply at a local shop. This is an adequate journal but expensive for what you get and limitations because of page size.\",\n",

When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).\",\n",

We usually end up entering the data when we get home so our app can tabulate everything for us in easy to read charts.I kind of like this too because it helps us to review what was going on during the day while we weren't at home.\",\n",

Before my baby was born, I purchased this and figured it's a nice-to-have item.I didn't realize until the first day home from the hospital how I would be RELYING on this simple, but easily organized log book. When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This book is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for the first 6 months. (I bought a second one after the 3 months one was done.)I used it to keep track of diaper changes and what kind (pee/poop), naps, and how long my baby nursed on each side. I also wrote notes for each day so I could see a history of reactions/milestones. It made it easier to figure out what gave my baby gas or why she slept better on certain days.Coupled with the Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Timer (which is also a necessity), I never really lost track (or my mind). It's also great for care-takers too, especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you! One of the most useful items yet.\",\n",

It is well constructed and attractive (though I must say not as nice as the quiet book my mother sewed for me as a toddler).The activities are:Page 1: Shape matching, different colored shapes match to same shaped outlines with velcro attachments. The velcro spots are a little small and flimsy.Page 2: Clock - the hands move freely, well constructed (my daughter isn't ready to learn the time but likes moving the arrows and talking about numbers)Page 3: Buttoning flowers to same colored buttons (this is too hard for my daughter to accomplish but I have her tell me where to button it by matching colors)Page 4: Tie the shoe - wish the string were a little longer which would make the task easierPage 5: Zip up the dress - my little one likes zippers - wish it had the ability to zip completely open so she could practice matching up the ends of the zipperPage 6: Buckle the pants buckle - this one is tricky!Page 7: Snap balloons on to color matched strings - the plastic snaps take a decent amount of pressure to apply and are a little hard to accomplishPage 8: 4 different texture and color swatchesOverall I think this book will last a long time and my daughter will be able to appreciate it more as she grows older.\",\n",

I also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when I brush my teeth.  He loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn't choke, you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking.This teether will be better if it had an on/ off button, my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on.

       "  'reviewText': 'I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, \"safety tested\" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear \"BPA free\" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn\\'t the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I\\'m sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I\\'m still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.',\n",

It was good to use while in the grocery store.  However, it pulled hard on my shoulder.Now, he's 7 months old, and he's crawling and pulling himself up, and he doesn't like to be restrained at all.  I've tried the kangaroo position, but I'm so scared he's going to fall out the bottom because he is quite a wiggle worm.

I must admit this is so much more comfortable than the front packs or back packs.  It doesn't cut across the back like the front packs can.  However, my daughter will not go in this.  I had tried from day one to carry her in this.  She screams.  My child hardly ever cries and when I say she screams, I mean turns red and screams.  As soon as I take her out she is fine.  Now that she is older I can carry her like a front pack, but quite honestly, the front pack is just easier.  I wanted to use the sling because I nurse and I should have been able to nurse her while we were out.  She just will not lay in it.  My friend has this and loves it.  Her baby cooperates.  She has carried him in it since she brought him home from the hospital.  She can nurse him while walking.  When my daughter gets older I plan on using it to carry her on my hip.  I watched the video and you can use it to help with back support while you carry your child on your hip.  I hope I can use it like that, but for the next baby, I am not going to use it.  I will stick with the traditional front pack.  These slings are just not very easy on larger women who are a rather endowed.\",\n",

Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn\\'t end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We\\'ve put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn\\'t sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.  That smell can bowl you over.*3) Easy enough for visitors to use- too difficult for them to play with.  Many of the \"grown-ups\" in my world can\\'t help but tinker with whatever new items are placed before them.  I\\'m thrilled they can\\'t figure out how to open the DC.

Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.  Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell!

This included reading reviews, asking friends (lots) about products that did and didn't work for them, and actually trying to use some of the products.  I decided to go w/ the Diaper Champ after learning that the overwhelming majority of my friends absolutely hated that leading diaper pail the Diaper Genie and actually trying to use that awful contraption.  In fact in one circle of friends the Diaper Genie was re-gifted about four times b/c they were simply trying to get rid of it. I also did not like the idea of having to buy the special bags that the Diaper Genie requires.  The diaper champ uses regular kitchen bags. I have NEVER experienced an odor problem.  If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!  I usually change mine twice a week on garbage day.-You still have to clean the thing!! I usually spray the inside w/ Lysol when I change the bag and/ or wipe it w/ antibacterial wipes.  On occasion I wipe it w/ cleaner just as I would clean by bathroom.-For those complaining about toddler diaper odors.  Toddlers eat solids, their poop smell very adult like!  We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.\",\n",

I read the reviews and found this one sounded the best.I love that it is so easy to use. My husband didn't even want a diaper pail because he didn't expect them to hold in any odors at all. Now that we have this one, he loves it. It's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper. No twisting till your wrist breaks. At first we were using scented trashbags, but I've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well. I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags. My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers. The only problem we've had is that if you don't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail. All in all it's been a great buy.\",\n",

But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works.  The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a  piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down).  The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily.  It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn.  This is not one handed operation as the box states.  After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.  And you do not even need to ask.  Yes, it was made in China.\",\n",

We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we've have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn't even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.

       "  'reviewText': 'The Champ is the ultimate in Diaper disposal.  We tried the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and more expense than we wanted (2 sets of refills every month).  The Diaper Champ uses regular trash bags (we like the scented 13 gallon bags by Ruffies) and is absolutely a no-brainer to operate!  Simply drop the diaper in the cubby on top and flip the handle!  The diaper falls into the belly of the champ and that\\'s it!  Drop and flip!  No twisting, shoving or cutting like the Genie.  And this is perfect for babies that grow into inquisitive toddlers - the Champ is much bigger than the Genie so it can\\'t be easily hauled around by an adventurous baby and it\\'s easy to keep her out of the messy contents as well (unlike regular diaper pails or trash cans)!Another reason I prefer the Champ is the fact that there are no \"blades\" involved.  I just didn\\'t like the idea of a diaper disposal with blades in my nursery.  The thought that someday she might get into the pail and possibly be cut on the sharp blades used for separating the bags - was frightening!  This is not a worry when it comes to the champ.  Just simple, clean, odor resistant, in-expensive to maintain/operate and safe!I\\'d recommend the Champ to anyone - buy it, you won\\'t be sorry!',\n",

We've been using it for almost 15 months now and still love it!  We save $$ on those expensive diaper genie refills AND it works great.  We put wet diapers in a seperate trash can (because they don't smell) and so we only put dirty diapers in the Diaper Champ so we only have to change the bag once a week and IT DOES NOT SMELL!!  A few times I'd forget to change it (I change it, my husband takes it out to the trash) and if a FULL bag of stinky diapers is left for more than a few days, it does begin to smell, but ANY diaper pail would stink if it was full for more than a few days.  So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!  :-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!\",\n",

I thought it would be silly to just throw away dirty diapers in there where I could just throw it in the trash can to save money. Then again, it was very useful since I have it next to the changing table. One, its holds seal tight of no smell in the baby bedroom. Two, no mess. Three, its very easy to use (all you need is to roll the handle back to dump the diaper and there it goes with a section for your next diaper). Well, my husband and I are very happy to get this in the mail.EDITED: 1/9/06At first I said it was great. But now I'm saying it stinks. It smells after about 3 months if you dont clean the champ itself. Such a hastle right? I think so, so I am going to recomment this item from great diaper champ to NOT SO GREAT DIAPER CHAMP. It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS! if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room. I still think old fashion trash can with a lid do much better cause one you know its full, you will throw the trash away. Im giving this a 1 start out of 5 stars.\",\n",

Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out. I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why).

Probably any diaper pail will do until your child is about six months old, and then none will work that great. Yes, you do have to air them out once in a while, and clean them frequently (yay for Lysol), but the plastic does absorb odors no matter what. Our Diaper Champ has reached its limit, and we are going to buy another one.Why another Champ, when it still lets out smells? All diaper pails smell!! Every mother of a two-year-old that I know is going to drastic lengths to air out their pail, no matter what brand they bought. No one will be reusing theirs for a second child.So I'm getting another Champ because I like these things:- I can use it with one hand and can keep the other hand on my baby- I don't have to buy special refils (I do use odor-fighting garbage bags that really help)- I don't have to explain how to use it to babysitters.That's it.

I have three complaints, the first is that you can only use about half the trash bag because of the way it dumps them in there which is kinda a waste. The second is that it doesn't twist shut like the genie does so when you open up the pail you smell all the lovely smells. The last is that it's top heavy when you open it up to put in the bag so you have to manuever it to put the bag in so it doesn't fall over but it can be done. That's the only time it smells though. My baby is breast fed so the smell isn't as bad as formula fed babies but our room smells fresh and clean. These minor details wouldn't make me change my mind. I like not having to buy expensive bags especially with all the other costs a baby brings, and it does keep the smell out which is what it's supposed to do.\",\n",

I have found it so much easier to use cheap ziplocks and throw diapers in regular trash that goes out each night anyway (both Diaper keepers required emptying every day &amp; would still smell).  I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.  Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.

       "  'reviewText': \"I spent a lot of time researching diaper pails before I actually bought one. I spoke to other parents to see what they used and most said that the Diaper Champ was leaps and bounds better than the alternatives. Now, owning one myself, I agree. I don't have any problems with oders (uless I'm changing out the bag) and I don't have to spend tons of money on the refill bags. You will be suprised how many diapers you change and how quickly the cost of those refills add up! My son is now 3 months old and we are still on our first box of kitchen sized trash bags....I have two very small complaints which is why I didn't give the Diaper Champ 5 stars. First, I think that it could have been made a little larger so you wouldn't have to change the bags as often. Second, you have to be VERY careful when changing out the bags. The lid is heavy and if it falls on your fingers you won't be really happy. It probably happens to everyone at least once. Overall this is an excellent product and I recommend it over all others out there.\",\n",

Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces.

However if you keep up with the maintance that problem is easily solved.Problem:  SmellAnswer:  Baking soda & regular maintanceThe great thing about the diaper champ is you can use regular bags, and it does keep the smell out. After some time with the Diaper Genie there was no way to stop the odor.Another thing, when the Champ starts stinking it is usaully past time to empty it. Empty the champ at least twice a week, if not more. We keep an air purifier in front of the diaper champ and that solves any strong smells when we don't empty it out on a regular basis.If you don't want to spend the money on the diaper champ, try a regular diaper pail with a lid. You would more than likely end up emptying the pail daily and that will keep the smell out(plus regulare maintance), and it is less expensive than the Diaper Champ.There are three diaper pails out that are cheaper:Safety 1st Diaper Pail: 8 gallons it's  a bit small$9.99 at Target & Babies R UsOdorless Diaper Pail: 13 gallons bags @ Target $16.99Easy Saver Daiper Pail: 8 gallons $14.99 @ Babies R UsI have not tried any of these so I can't honestly review them. These are if you are looking for cheaper alternative. I would buy one of these over the Diaper Genie or Diaper Dekor.I still give it 4 stars. It does it job and a lot better than the Diaper Genie or Diapre Dekor, no expensive refills. Everyone has kitchen trash bags that can be used with the Champ or regular grocery bags could be put to use. The good thing about using grocery bags is you will be emptying the diaper champ on a dialy basis therefore elimating build up on odor.I have the older diaper champ and opening the lid to empty the pail was a bit of a hassle. It is enough of a detterent. You get the hang of it.\",\n",

I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they're nuts!

His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ.Usually we change the bag about once a week, every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week. I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me. They've got to be doing something wrong.Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned...if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do, and you get poop on the pail, it does need to be wiped off.

With the diaper champ you can use any kind of bags which is great!!! There really is no oder with the diaper champ. We take the dirty diaper out every 4-5 days depends on how many we go through in a weeks time :), but even when their is a \"dirty\" diaper there is no smell in the room. Sometimes if we have a very \"messy diaper\" we just take it directly to the garage. All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama. We wash it out once a month or sooner with bleach and water just help get rid of some germs. We also spray it with cleaner weekly to help with those nasty germs! All around its a great product.

When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier.

I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!  Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!\",\n",

What a disappointment!  Here are the big two complaints:1.  It's unsanitary.  Putting diapers and messy wipes into the slot and dumping them in the bucket leaves the slot a germy mess.  Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work!  And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2.  The smell.  It's probably not as bad with an infant, but let me tell you, opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience!  Yikes, what a smell after just a couple days.  We used the odor prevention garbage bags, but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid.  Since nothing seals off the individual diapers, it's just a sea of messy diapers in there.  Yuck.On the plus side, it's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags, not the expensive ones the Genie requires.  And it's certainly easy to use.  But I'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year, we'll be going back to the Diaper Genie.  It's not perfect, but it's much cleaner and there's less odor involved (the reason to get one of these products in the first place).  And the new version of the Genie is much easier to operate than the earlier model, so we'll just cross our fingers the lid stays attached next time.\",\n",

The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail, and then they drop through to the bag.  Well, messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area, and it was not easy to clean.  Finally, after two months of dealing with this pail, one morning, I flipped the handle, and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail.  (It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it, either!)

When my daughter turned one, she started disposing of her diapers herself and she never failed!We used regular grocery bags and changed them twice a week to avoid them getting too full and/or smelly. [We've discovered that regular shopping bags from Target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we're now using them with daughter #2, replacing them once a week]. We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001! It's virtually indestructible, easy to wash and operate, doesn't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it, and it DOES NOT SMELL!I would highly recommend this product to anyone.\",\n",

I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don't have to purchase specific bags.  That's way too much of a headache and expense that I don't need.  It's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.

       "  'reviewText': \"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail. I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags. Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.' In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!! I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week. For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!! Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two. SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful. Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.\",\n",

They do give instuctions, saying to just use a slate next to the thickers corner one(for convertable cribs), but I find it fits very awkwardly.  However taking the whole crib apart(with the bumper being a huge deal, also to get on, considering the thick corner posts), it makes me want to cry to think I'd have to do this very often.  So, we'll give these a shot.  I may end up doing the zip on sheet set, which would work with any crib, and seems like a dream.  I've also heard great things about those.

I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it. The snaps work well on small crib rails. They may not fit around larger crib posts.

The first time I tried to put in on the mattress, I was fussing and swearing at it and was sweating my butt off trying to get it hooked on. It is not intuitive at all to snap on:1) The snap bands aren't placed equidistant so you just have to guess at where they should go.2) In order to snap the opposite side you have to lean over and INTO the crib (or you have to pull it away from the wall)...3) All while trying to stick your fingers through the slats to pull the bands through and snap them.4) Once I had the bands hooked where it seemed they should...I got to the opposite end and there was NO WAY the bands were hooking--it was a few inches too short! GRRRRRRR!At that point, sweaty and frustrated, I gave up and threw the damn thing at my husband and told him to do it. Since then, I've had to do it myself, and I still hate it although I am getting better.The pros?It is nicely waterproof. When the boy spits up or his diaper leaks or he sweats a lot, it does not make it through to the mattress. But that said, it's not like there's a lot of liquid to worry about.We haven't had any issue with the snaps not staying snapped or the baby getting underneath the sheet.Overall?We are still using this, although I am not quite sure why. There has to be another solution that doesn't cause me mental anguish trying to put it on (although, honestly, sheets of any kind are a PITA). So I give it three stars, but with a warning that it's a pain to put on.\",\n",

It was given as a gift & I put one more on my registry after realizing I had to take the whole crib ensemble apart to change the sheet!  Now I change the sheet only occasionally & it is more for asthetics.  The Ultimate Cribe sheet snaps off & I put a clean one on - so easy & practical!  Save money on sheets & just get one or two decorative sheets & get at least 2 of these!!!Update at 7 mos (July04): I have survived VERY WELL with 2 of the Ultimate Crib Sheets - and boy when they start slithering around the crib & wetting through diapers & spitting up solids - you will be SO thankful to have this little dandy item!

       "  'reviewText': 'We registered for the Ultimate Crib Sheet because a cousin and a few friends raved about it - they said to get two so that one could be on the crib and one could be in the wash.  I received it at my baby shower, but we have found only limited value in this crib sheet for our 11 month old daughter.  I am glad we only have one of these!The Ultimate Crib Sheet that we have is the style with elastic straps on each corner, one fully-removable elastic strap in the center of the short end, and two straps on each long end.  We have a Pali Wendy 4-in-1 Convertible Crib and the corner posts are quite thick, to the point where the elastic straps are not long enough to easily go around the corners.  Instead on one end of the crib we have to resort to wrapping the straps around the crib slats adjacent to the corner posts and that means there\\'s slightly less than full coverage of the sheet underneath.  Since our daughter is a \"perimeter\" sleeper who likes to be up against the edges of her crib, that is a problem.The majority of parents we know have purchased convertible cribs which have thick corner posts when configured as a crib or toddler bed. It would be easy for Summer Infant to make this sheet more adaptable to current crib styles by making the length of the corner straps longer or using multiple snap sockets to make the strap length adjustable.  This sheet fits better on a standard/traditional crib with thinner diameter corner posts.I also question the real value of this for older babies who move around in their cribs.  We have the crib bumper on now despite not having used it between 1-8 months of age because she is a real mover and likes to stay on the perimeter of her crib to sleep - she was sticking limbs out between crib slats and woke up crying as a result.  On the handful of occasions where she\\'s thrown up in her crib (always when she\\'s come down with an upper respiratory bug), she\\'s inevitably hosed the bumper as well.  In those cases we have to just strip the whole crib anyways so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is of little real utility for us.I could see this being a big time saver for parents with traditional cribs or those with babies/toddlers who often have various \"accidents\" in their cribs and need to frequently change a crib sheet on the fly.  However we have found that a waterproof pad under a normal crib sheet works just fine for our baby.',\n",

My baby would sweat profusely.  We always keep our house at 68-70 and dressed him in a cotton sleeper.  If he was laying on his back, his chest would be cool, but his back would be hot and sticky.  Or if laying on his stomach, his front would be sweaty, but his back cool.  Basically, whatever was touching the mattress pad could not breath and it was uncomfortable no matter what temperature adjustment we made.I will say the design configuration is very practical and a great idea.  Changing a fitted mattress sheet is a giant pain in the butt.  This pad makes it easy to clean up the crib after an accident and speed is critical in the middle of the night.I purchased a felted 100% wool mattress pad instead and couldn't be happier.  It was slightly more expensive, but it was worth it.  Wool is a truly fabulous product: very breathable, helps regulate body temp, naturally water resistant, anti bacterial and NATURAL!!!!

       "  'reviewText': \"Yes, scratchy!  I was quite surprised by the rough texture of the top layer of the sheet.  It feels like very cheap, low thread count material, not nearly as soft as most bedsheets.  When my daugher used this sheet, she had a skin rash and started getting a bold spot on the back of her head.  It's possible, of course, that these were unrelated to the sheet.  However, both problems improved substantially when we removed it and put her on a softer, normal bed sheet.Also, I agree with another poster that this could be a dangerous product, especially if your baby is older and moves around her crib a lot.  There is no way to tuck the sides under, as with a regular sheet, so a baby could find her way under the sheet and suffocate.  Keep in mind, too, that undoing the snaps is very easy--so easy, a baby could do it!  The elastic bands connecting the sheet to the crib also make me nervous.  Could an older baby pinch or strangle herself in these?My daughter is now six months, and rolls around her crib.  I won't be regularly using this sheet anymore.  But, there is an upside.  This product is AMAZINGLY easy to use.  Snap, snap--that's it.  There is no lifting the mattress.  And it is waterproof underneath (unlike a certain zipper sheet, I could name), so in an emergency you don't have to worry about the mattress.  Recently, my daughter had a stomach virus, diarrhea everywhere.  To make matters worse, I caught it and was too light-headed to lift a 20lb crib mattress.  This sheet was perfect.\",\n",

I don't hate them, but I don't like them and will never purchase them again. The idea is wonderful, but parts of the product are too cheaply made. Within the first washing, some of the snaps were pulled off the sheet (with following the directions to re-snap the sheet before washing). That was disappointing. Thankfully, it was only 2 snaps and I was still able to make the sheet function. However, it does take some time to snap the sheet on securely and it isn't very soft or cozy for baby. It has kept accidents from leaking through and it did work well in that area, but as far as adding coziness or comfort or ease of use...it failed miserably. I bought mine through Babies R Us instead of Amazon but wanted to contribute a review regarding the product because I shop through Amazon much more often. I wish I had been better informed, I would have gotten the quick zip sheets instead. The attachments for the snaps are not well made and I would not recommend this product to new moms. Go for a different crib pad that will protect and add some softness/coziness to the crib. This sheet also does not retain warmth well - even after throwing in the dryer and then putting on crib, it cools quickly and remains cool which may be nice in the summer but not during a winter in South Dakota...One more additional note, it does take a very long time for these sheets to dry - an extra dry cycle in the dryer.

There are always loose straps hanging off or awkward folds in it when we try to strap it down. We tried over and over again to get it right, but to no avail. We do not believe this is an issue with our crib as it is a brand new, high quality one. We finally gave up the idea of strapping the Ultimate Crib Sheet down and now just put it under the regular crib sheet.

About a month after we started my daughter had a string of accidents at night out of the blue.  I was constantly changing sheets and was tired of it, that is when I found this.  Turns out my daughter was sick at the time, but once I got two of these it was so easy to just move her and take this pad off to wash it instead of stripping and remaking the bed.  I wish I had known about this when I first started potty training (for nap time and bedtime).  It is also relatively small to pack if you are traveling somewhere and you are afraid of your child wetting the bed this is great for that too.  I now have this off of her bed again, but I can't say enough good stuff about this product.\",\n",

My 4-year old has slept in a full-size bed since he turned 2.  These pads really work (no leaks!), are comfortable and wash-up well.  I only have 2 complaints ... 1. the side-flaps aren\\'t quite long enough to fully tuck under if you have a pillow-top mattress (although you can make it work if one side of the bed is against the wall and you pull the opposite side really tight)  AND  2. the top and bottom of the pad tend to \"curl up\" after several washings.  Despite these complaints, I have not been able to find a pad that is even near the quality and comfort of this one.  The reason that I own 5 of these is that, if you truly want \"full\" coverage on the bed for a child that rolls all over while sleeping, you need to use 2 with some slight overlap (so, 2 to use and 2 for back-up).  I also use one (full-size) on the Spinmaster Flip-Open Sofa to keep spills and accidents from staining the sofa.  The full-size fully covers the full-length of the sofa.  I think this is a \"must have\" product for parents of toddlers that don\\'t want to be constantly changing bed sheets or trying to \"wash\" a children\\'s sofa that really isn\\'t meant to be washed.(fyi ... If you like Basic Comfort\\'s Ultimate Crib Sheet, then you\\'ll also like their Handy\\'s Plus Pad.  The Handy\\'s Plus Pad is basically the Ultimate Crib Sheet with side flaps and without the snaps.  In fact, the pad portion of the Handy\\'s Plus Pad - Full size is almost the same size as the Ultimate Crib Sheet.)',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I bought this power strip cover to protect my toddler from the power strip we have under a chest in our living room. The design is sturdy and fits our power strip perfectly, it is also easy to put  together. But it has two big minuses:1. Its height. The wires can bend but this is about 1 inch higher than the plugs, so if you want this to go under a piece of furniture you may want to consider whether it fits under or not. It barely fits under our chest.2. THE REAL ISSUE: The width of the slot through which the cables come out. MY TODDLER's HAND AND A PORTION OF HIS ARM fit through the slot perfectly, so he can reach the outlets AND the switch of the power cord. What is the point of this item? We just hope, at this point, that it will be a further discouragement--and since the piece is all but wedged under the chest, we will get to him before he can pull the thing close enough to stick his little hand in. Hopefully we'll find something better soon.You can presumably use it by covering every unused outlet in the cord with outlet covers. Although the toddler will be able to reach in, he will probably not have the strength or dexterity to pull out the outlet covers while his hand movements are limited by this shell. This, of course, would not stop him/her from turning the switch off--in our case, this means resetting the clock and being without a phone for however long it takes us to notice the deed, among other bothers.In summary: buy it only if you mean to attach it to the wall. And if you are planning to do the wall, keep in mind that this is pretty big--like attaching a 1L bottle of soda to your wall, only it is a solid, ugly off-white contraption with wires spewing off it.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'My little one looooves plug ins.  This product prevents her from unplugging my electronic devices, from trying to plug things into the power strip, and from flipping the power strip into the off position.  It keeps my child and my electronics safe!My only critique of this item is that it seems a bit flimsy when fully extended.  The power strip for my entertainment center is a pretty standard length and size and fits in this strip cover with the cover extended fully.  When extended, the cover can wiggle, and if wiggled enough, little hands could possibly figure out how to separate the two pieces, thus gaining access to the power strip.  In an effort to avoid this scenario, I have placed the product placed far enough under my entertainment center that my child would really have to reach to get to it, so the level of concentration that it would take her to both reach for the power strip and open the cover is beyond what she is capable of doing.I am still satsified with this product despite its weakness when fully extended, however, because when I placed the bare power strip in the exact same location, my daughter had no problem both reaching for the power strip and flicking it into the off position.  Furthermore, seeing all those cords, outlets, and plugs motivated her to move the power strip to where she could reach it better and within a matter of moments, she would happily turning it on and off, unplugging things, and trying to \"plug\" foreign objects into it.  So another thing this product succeeds in doing is making the power strip less attractive for her by covering up all the things she likes most about them- buttons, plug ins, and outlets.If this device were more readily accessible (ie: out in the open) I think my daughter would have no problem figuring out how to open it and thus rendering it useless.  It might not have the same problem with a smaller power strip because the product wouldn\\'t need to be fully extended.',\n",

We\\'ve been using it for 9 months, and my toddler (who is now almost 2) seems quite safe.  She\\'s pulled on the handle of the oven a few times (and we\\'ve told her \"no\", which she seems to accept most of the time) and the lock has stayed put.  She\\'s tried to operate the lock a few times, and has not been successful at that either.  I can see a toddler who is very interested in the lock being able to figure it out, but she has been easily diverted from it.It\\'s held up great, and I don\\'t find it too cumbersome to lock/unlock it whenever I use the oven (which is pretty often - I cook a lot). I have no complaints.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"As with everything about being a parent, locks are more complicated than you'd have thought (or would like!):SCREW-MOUNTED MAGNETIC LOCKS:  The Safety 1st Tot-Lok Locks can be difficult to install, especially on drawers, but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure.  Still, most people may want to try the adhesive locks (see below) first, to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly.Pros:+ Very nice & secure once installed, especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed.+ Works vertically or horizontally ... that is, on the side of a door or the top.+ Can easily be switched to hold the lock open, for when no children are aroundCons:- Complicated to install, especially in some situations.  So you might not get around to installing them, given all the other demands on your time.- Requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part, plus some small holes to attach- May require some new tools - a collar lock, to keep from drilling through the door; and a right angle chuck for tight spacesIf you plan to be in your home for a while, and want a finished, secure set of locks, the Tot Loks may be a good choice.One note, if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs.ADHESIVE MOUNT MAGNETIC LOCKS: The KidCo Adhesive Mount Magnet Locks will only work in some spots, but it's still a good lock to try first, for a lot of people, because it works well (in the right situations) and is easy to install.  Buy some and see how they work on your cabinets.  Once you've tried a few, it's a lot easier to see where'll they'll work or won't work.Pros:+ Quick to install, after a few minutes of figuring it out+ No drilling required, so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetsCons:- Only installs horizontally (along the top edge of a door or drawer), given the way they use gravity to lock.We just use the adhesive mount, no additional screws, for some furniture we didn't want to drill holes into.  They seem to be strong enough so far, especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while - if it won't open, they lose interest.  I don't know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling.HOOK LOCKS:  The advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type (like theMommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock) is that the hooks have a lot more play (they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock). So a child can bang them back and forth - they might not open the door or drawer, but they will make a racket.  Maybe OK in some situations, but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors.SLIDE LOCKS:  Slide locks (such as theAmerican Red Cross Cabinet Safety Slide Lock) are very quick and easy to install, if they fit.  But they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock, so if they are within reach they aren't much of a barrier to older kids.  And even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors.  However, they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel.FLEX LOCKS:  Flex locks (like the Safety First Cabinet Flex-Lock (see reviews) orCabinet Flex-Lock 2-Pack) are strong and easy to install, and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure (unlike the magnetic locks, which are designed to be out of sight).  So you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink; or use them when you travel.  And as a bonus, they are so secure that even some adults can't open them! ;-)  (They do take two hands to open.)  Not attractive, but they do the job if you keep them tightened.\",\n",

We bought these magnet latches to put on our drawers in the kitchen and what a dream!! Another reviewer suggested two keys. Definitely. We only have one and are going to purchase another. Small price to pay for security. The thing I like about these is that if your little one is out of the house for the day, or they outgrow them, meaning they are old enough to be safe around knives and such, you can fix them where they don't require the key!  One drawback: If you have a double-wide or single-wide mobile home, you will have to do some modifications to your drawers to get them to work. My husband spent an entire evening working on three drawers due to the modifications needing to be made for them to work correctly for our drawers. After it was all done, it works perfectly. Also, a small price to pay for the security of my little angel. Do yourself a favor and invest a little money and get these latches!!!!\",\n",

We prefer to leave our on at all times (even when our children don't need the cabinets locked anymore) because they are easy to turn off (just a flip of the red tab inside the cabinet) that way they are there whenever you have little ones visiting your home.  We have never split a cabinet and we don't think it takes that much longer to install then any other cabinet locks.  You will have to drill in you cupboard doors but your little one(s) will be protected.  It leaves no room for fingers to get pinched either.

They also have a mechanism to keep the lock in the open position, like if you need to get in a cabinet a lot, or the kids are older and you don't need them anymore.

Visitors to the house found it impossible to work, because we had to have the magnet positioned just so.  That is actually a good safety feature, because the kids know the magnet opens the drawers and would attempt to open the drawers when they get their hands on the magnet.As far as keeping the kids out, it worked well.  I'd say it's been in our drawer for about six years.  We no longer use it and it hasn't worked well for about a year or so.  The magnet no longer unlatches the lock and we can't get into the drawer.This is a good lock, but require the willingness to drill into the woodwork of your cabinets.

After which, I received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item; SERIOUSLY!  1. Do you think I am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it?  2.  If I described the defect as a sliver of metal, the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item, as a sliver denotes a very small piece, so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like.  3.  If the seller needed a picture, this should have been requested in the first email, not in a second email.  I shop online because I have limited time.  I do not have time to respond to an email trail for a $3 nail clip.  However, I am so irritated with the product and the seller's response that I decided to write this review.

       "  'reviewText': 'Safety 1st makes several nail clippers for babies, including model 49523 (Safety 1st Hospital\\'s Choice Steady Grip Nail Clippers); model 49539 (Safety 1st Complete Nail Care Set) which includes what seems to be clippers similar to model 49523 but with a holder at the back for emery boards; and model 10435 (this one). All three of these nail trimmers are in the \"Hospital\\'s Choice\" series.Overall, I prefer the 49523/49539 model (see Customer Images) because it is more comfortable to hold for the following reasons.  First, instead of a small white plastic bulb, the 49523/49539 has a larger white-and-orange or white-and-blue handle that allows you to hold the clippers like a \"gun\" with your index finger under the blades and your thumb on the lever.  Second, the orange or blue part of the 49523/49539 handle is soft and less slippery than the white plastic of this model.  Third, the lever has the same soft orange or blue non-skid rubbery material at the end, thus providing a cushion for your thumb.In terms of cutting nails, the very good performance of this model and the 49523/49539 are the same. (They both leave the nail edges a little sharp, so some filing is necessary.) So I recommend purchasing the 49523/49539 instead.',\n",

It's sharp enough to cut nails on the first try and the white bulb is pretty comfortable to hold.  What more do you need in a pair of baby nail clippers?The losers:- Safety 1st model 49539 (has the holder for emery boards) - the grip is comfortable but the clippers are blunt and therefore useless.  The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper (the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring) - has the safety guard so you don't catch the baby's skin in the clippers, but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail.  Plus, it's not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness, but something about the way it's designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby's nails.Search ends here, thank goodness!\",\n",

Just as I was about to clip one of his nails, he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger.  His finger bled, my son cried and I panicked.  Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage.  But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company.  They are VERY safe.  I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents.

I've tried this in my mouth, it isn't comfortable like regular pacifiers at all and it took so long to reach a temperature I took it out of my mouth before it was done, this was over 2 minutes so I don't even know if this thing is accurate at all.My girls were preemies and this was WAY too big for them. I've tried to use this thing many different times and my girls always spit it right out, even if I tried to hold it there they would push it out with their tongue, they HATE it. My girls are currently 14 months old and love their Binky pacifiers but I've tried to get them to use this to take their temps several times and they make a face & push it right out.My girls HATE & have always hated having their temperature taken under the arm pit but they do not mind it taken rectally, it IS very easy and the most accurate. I use an Exergen Temperal for when they are sleeping because it is accurate enough to let me know if they have a temp and if it is a high temp. If it shows they have a higher temp then I get them up and take their temp rectally to make sure I get the most accurate temperature. I recommend the Vicks Rectal Thermometer for that.I think companies make products like the pacifier thermometer because as new parents it sounds like a good idea but in reality, they just don't work and I'm sure your Dr will tell you the same thing.\",\n",

Anyway, before I had the baby, I bought my husband a bath head cushion (the kind you blow up) from Target which he never used (too girly I guess). Turns out it is the perfect cushion (it has suction cups) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths. It has grooves so baby's head doesn't flop everywhere. I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body. The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back.

Its ability to be easily stored was a big plus in the hospital, as well as at home.  The NICU nurse recommended that we line any infant tub with one of those baby bath sponges (ours is yellow and in the shape of a bear).  We use our tub in the kitchen sink.  Leaks, pinches and mildew have never been a problem.  Oddly enough, we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards (once she could hold up her head).  This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair.  We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby's torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold.  Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months, but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months.  Our baby loves bath time!- Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds.

       "  'reviewText': \"I have been using this tub since my sons very first bath. At first he hated to take a bath and now he loves it. I love the fact that it folds up very easily and will fit into a closet when folded. I have never had a problem with it growing mold or smelling musty. After the bath I wipe it dry with a towel fold it up and put it in the closet. I also have a newborn to toddler tub, which is very large and I have nowhere to store it.I have never had a problem with it leaking. As long as you don't overfill it, it works just fine. I find this tub to be better than the more expensive ones. The only problem I have is that my six month old son is too big for this tub, but at $12.99, is that really such a big deal? I feel I got my moneys worth out of it. If you are looking for a tub that is safe and easy to store I recommend this one.\",\n",

Well, I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning. Also, I have yet to get it to shrink, so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time. The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller, but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick. However, that causes him to slide down the sling and it's quite hard where the sling ends, so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back. Also, it just doesn't seem to hold water. I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out. All in all, I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks, I am getting another one.\",\n",

Here\\'s how it happens: Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are \"clicked\" into place (and yes, we did read the instructions) we fill the tub. Once we finish bathing her, we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain. It is at this point that by moving the tub, the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub, it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks....all over the hardwood floors. And let me tell you, it isn\\'t easy to remedy this while holding a wet, squirmy baby. Mothers (and fathers) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess. My husband, an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal. Look at it! Meanwhile, we\\'re shopping for a different type of tub.

In the beginning, we used the infant sling, but my baby would constantly slip down into the water.  We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping, but we still had to readjust him quite frequently.  When he learned to sit on his own, we tried using the bath seat feature.  He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring, thus painfully squishing his private parts.  We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him, but we managed.  Now he twists and turns and won't stay put in the tub.  I have thought about buying a better tub, but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub, I don't want to spend the money.  Please consider buying something different for your baby.

He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way, too!

He didn't really seem to enjoy it either.  Finally, after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath.  LOVE IT!!!!!  From day one my son had a great time in his new (huge) tub.  He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub, with no slipping.  He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash.  We've had it over a month, I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Superyard XT is an excellent product for child containment, providing exactly the protection a parent desires for outdoor play. It isn't a very large gate- even when fully extended, it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen. But it offers enough space to keep one or two kids (and their toys) safely occupied.Superyard XT holds up well and I have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems. It is very easy to clean and to transport. The panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still. The panels do not fold completely flat- they do have some thickness, so don't expect this gate to fit into a tiny space. It needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together.The panels on Superyard XT are not very tall and because of this, the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age. As children get older, they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down, making it impractical as a containment device. But the shorter height has one clear advantage: It makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over. There is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside.Superyard XT is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly. The gates cannot be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner. Each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy. Placed in a straight line, the gate cannot resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push.The only complaint I have with Superyard XT is the small space it covers. With the limited space, some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate. Depending on the number of toys your kids have, one child might be all that will fit. This is why I strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit. This kit consists of two additional panels and while this doesn't sound like much, it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems.Overall, Superyard XT is a very good gate for child or pet containment. I brushed it off when I first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use, marketed solely to take our hard earned money. But now that I own the Superyard, I cannot imagine life without this containment device. It offers kids a place to play where they are well- protected, giving parents some much needed peace of mind.\",\n",

The 'Superyard XT' is also great for puppies, and more humane than crating them for hours.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the gate that opens (so you can get in the 'Superyard') is awkward and somewhat difficult to work.

       "  'reviewText': 'I recently purchased this yard when my twins ((now nearly 8 months old)) started to become mobile.I have yet to baby-gate my entire house, but I have super-yard\\'ed the family room! I have it shaped as a square, and have those alphabet puzzle peice foam squares inside, to protect my carpet. The boys enjoy being able to actually see through the holes, and be able to play with many of their toys ((rather than being confined in a pack n play)). It is pretty sturdy if used properly, I mean if I or any other adult were to fall on it, obviously it would collapse. It DOES fold, but not at all compactly, and I would say that it would most-likely take up my entire mini-van trunk if I were to travel with it... so if you are looking for a compact on-the-go type of play-yard, look else-where. I do like that you can configure it to fit an oddly-shaped play area, or even remove/add panels ((sold separately which we did not buy)) to make it larger or smaller. Also, due to it being plastic ((very well rounded I may add, no sharp edges!)) we will be able to start bringing it outdoors as well now that the weather is improving!I also am planning on purchasing another one to use to \"gate off\" 2 over-sized entrance ways to my family room. My husband believes if we screw 3 hooks ((with the full hole, not the 1/2 hole) to either side of each door frame, and then attatch those strong zip-ties to the hooks and the holes in the gate, that it will work. Of course, this will do damage to our walls, but it is the only solution I see fit with such a large doorway ((please note that these are NOT meant for stairs, or doorways. They are NOT baby gates... this is just a creative suggestion I thought I would mention)). And, one of my friends owns one, and used it to surround her christmas tree last year, which I thought was an AMAZING idea!I think that once our boys master crawling, and eventually walking that the super-yard will prove even more valuable than it is now!',\n",

I expect a new product not to just pop right into position, but it formed a hexagon rather easily.  That's the key---no assembly required!  My daughter is 7 months old and when she pushes herself up on her front arms and tips over onto her back, she occasionally bonks her head on the &quot;wall&quot; of the pen.  She gave herself a nice red spot on her head when she hit the &quot;hinge joint&quot; part of the pen that concerned me, but it wouldn't be very effective if it wasn't sturdy.  The mesh lattice walls seem to have a little give in them.  To remedy it as best as I could, I have placed stuffed animals or larger toys in front of the corners.  I still think that her rare head bonks are a good trade off for other huge catastrophies that would be occuring daily in or house.  She doesn't protest to being put in it because she has a sense of freedom and scoots all around and is still be able to see us.  And we can keep an eye her as well.  It is the perfect size as not to intrude on living room space but big enough to hold her ever-growing little body and a ton of her toys.

He is very active and likes to jump very high, but he can not jump over the gate. He tries to push the gate in attempt to escape but the gate does not move. The gate is high enough so that he can not jump over. It contains his crate, wee-wee pad and food bowl with plenty of room for him to play around in. I bought a second one to use as a gate to keep him from going up our stairs. Very sturdy product and we plan on using this also when we have kids. One drawback is the gate is a little difficult to open at times in case you want to just walk in. But I guess that is the good thing also so who ever you have inside can't get out.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Welcome to the toddling/scootching/crawling years, where you can\\'t ever get a break unless you have some way of keeping junior from getting away.The SuperYard is a foldable rigid-plastic fencing system for creating what we called back in the day a play pen. It\\'s designed to be reconfigurable for a given area, so that the enclosure can be made to fit odd spaces. It works for indoor and outdoor areas, and the optional extensions can be used to make rather large enclosures quite easily.We bought this as a replacement for the Pack-N-Play type portable play yard. Our son, at 10 months or so, had clearly outgrown this smaller type yard, and was quite unhappy at the limiting horizons of its opaque blue walls. The SuperYard has been a very good, albeit not completely perfect, solution for providing some portable play space that requires somewhat lighter supervision than a freeplay in an open room. Our son\\'s now closing in on 14 months and this has been useful for that purpose.It\\'s not 100% easy to set up and reconfigure, and there\\'s a reason for that. The extra difficulty with piecing the \"end\" sections together means it\\'s nearly impossible for a tot to open or close this by their lonesomes. It takes some strength and adult wile to open the sections and bend the connectors at various angles to thus reconfigure the overall shape. There\\'s a slight trick to negotiating the opening mechanism in a panel, but once you \"get it\", it\\'s easy enough. I suspect many of the comments about difficulty of set-up were written by those who had just set the thing up for the first time or who don\\'t move it around a lot and who have forgotten \"the trick\". We\\'re on our fourth month of using ours, and it\\'s very easy now to open and close the corral, as we call it (perhaps in part because we do it frequently).One of the big advantages of this type of arrangement is the shape of the enclosure can be changed. I think some of the comments about this being unstable are either from those who are unrealistically expecting a completely rigid structure, or those who may have assembled it in a way that the shape is unstable. If you put a 120 degree angle at each of \"joints\" and form at least a hexagon (with the basic model) or an octagon (with the model plus one extension), you get an incredibly stable structure. I can demonstrate this by putting my full 200+ lb weight on the edge when it\\'s open, in which case there\\'s considerable flex, versus when it\\'s closed in an octagon shape, in which case it barely gives and I can practically do a push-up on it.Of course the whole thing can slide -- it\\'s made out of plastic and it\\'s not attached to anything! Your little bruiser may be able to push it around a bit, but your average baby isn\\'t going to get very far. If the structure is set up in a way that it\\'s got some sort of limiter (a wall, for instance) keeping it from moving too far, this really ought not be a problem. The idea is for creating a play yard you can set up easily an in a variety of places, and anything that\\'s fixed permanently is not going to serve that purpose. That\\'s your trade-off with this type of yard versus a smaller crib or similar yard.The expectation for this should be as a semi-temporary safe play area. I would recommend it for creating a \"safe\" play zone in an otherwise unsafe area -- an unchild-proofed room or outside (where we use it from time to time). It is not to create an undersupervised area, except perhaps for  a quick deposit of your tot while you go to the bathroom or answer the door, etcetera.  We use this in the room that has our computer -- despite our attempts to childproof this area, it\\'s pretty impossible given the requirements of computer cabling. The SuperYard has at least made a part of this room safe enough.As for being able to climb over it -- there may be some prodigious children who can scale this using the lattice work as foot-rests, but I strongly suspect they can scale other things as well. Our little guy can pull up on the frame, and it occasionally slips a few inches, but I don\\'t know a lot of toddlers coordinated enough to know how to climb a fence AND who have small enough feet to use the rather small lattice openings. (If you want to be extra sure, just put the kid in some shoes, which will make it impossible to use his toes to grab the lattice holes.)I do recommend getting at least one extension, as the extra two panels nearly double the available surface area options, and if you don\\'t need them you can literally just fold them over without having to detach them.The portability has been excellent -- once you get the knack of how much pressure you need to collapse the sections, it folds up like an accordion, and there\\'s a carrying strap that doubles as a restraining strap to keep the folds together while under transport. Folded up, it takes up about as much space as the smaller Pack N Play but at about half the weight.Where this has been less than ideal has more to do with our kid than the product. He doesn\\'t like being left alone in it, but neither does he like being left alone in any of his other confinements (e.g. crib). The fact that he can see out the SuperYard is a big help; with the old Graco PackNPlay, the opaque sides meant he couldn\\'t see a parent even if quite close. So while he objects to being set down alone, a little distraction with a forgotten toy and the reassurance of being able to see the parent through the \"wall\" usually suffices to make us both happy.',\n",

The Superyard is fantastic when it comes to size and it very sturdy if you mount it to the wall or bolt it into the floors but we prefer not to put holes all over the walls or into our concrete slab. So we did not get to enjoy the gates fullest potential.The Good:1. Very tall2. Has options available to make it sturdy and permanent in placement.3. Able to see though the gates, great for both parent and child.4. Easy to fold up (with some elbow grease)5. Very Very easy to store away.6. White color, very nice can match just about anything.7. Somewhat easy to wash (not like the plastic walls on the Playzone - you just wipe clean), we had to take the gate into the yard and rinse it off with the water hose.8. If it is not bolted into the walls it is quick and easy to take down for more space verses other products such as the Playzone are pretty permantent once in place (they are just too big and bulky)All in all I gave the Superyard XT 4 stars because it has options to make it as sturdy as the more expensive ones out there, but the more expensive ones do not require screws, or holes to your home to complete the job. If you want to use the Superyard as an extensive gate to block entranceways this gate is fantastic in every way. If you are buying to use as a Playyard, then buy the Playzone if you have an extra fifty bucks.',\n",

The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.

They can't throw it and it has rounded edges, so it's safe for them.  It lights up and eventually we'll all associate those different colors with the different musical scores.I think for the price it is worth it without a doubt.  Probably the price has come down and this used to be much more expensive because I notice in the earlier reviews mention about the high price.

I hesitated to purchase this after watching a video review on here showing the violin sound.  I have played piano for 26 years and violin for 23 so I might be pickier than some as  far as the sound.  I\\'m so glad I got it despite the negative reviews and it doesn\\'t bother me that the sounds aren\\'t completely authentic.  (I\\'d also like to note that the violin is the worst sounding one, the other instruments sound more like the real thing in my opinion.)  I love that you can hear each instrument\\'s part separately and choose which instruments you would like to play together.  My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys, and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he\\'s doing to start another song then go back to playing.  As he gets older it will be neat to show him that while each instrument plays similar but different parts, they all go together to make a pretty song.The toy seems very sturdy, although after several months of play the \\'harp\\' button has to be pushed a little harder than the others for some reason.',\n",

For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.

       "  'reviewText': 'There are really mixed reviews for this product, and I think this is for two reasons: 1) the fact that different people are looking to this product with very different ideas of what they think their kids will get out of it and 2) the fact that the product quality really did go downhill when Munchkin took over from Embryonics.  Let me try to help you sort out both points.Before I do, I should mention that I originally got the Munchkin version, didn\\'t like it, and ended up replacing it with the original Embryonics version, which I like much better.  My 19-month-old seemed to enjoy both versions.Before you get this product, ask yourself, \"What value do I think it will have for my child?\"  Here are a few possibilities:1) You just want some kind of musical toy with which the child can interact to change the song that\\'s playing.  If this is your thought, you will probably be happy with either version of this toy.  (Then again, if that\\'s ALL you want, you\\'d probably be just as happy with theBaby Einstein Take Along Tunestoy, which my son enjoys, and which is both cheaper and more portable.)2) You want a musical toy that\\'s a bit more interactive, where the child can change the sound of the song that\\'s on.  In this case, you\\'d also probably be happy with either version of this toy.  My 19-month-old son loves to press the buttons to turn on and off different instruments, change the song playing, and just listen to the music and dance and clap to it.  He does seem to enjoy this more than the Baby Einstein player mentioned above, perhaps because he can change things up in a greater variety of ways.3) You hope that your child will start to recognize the sound of different instruments from this toy.  If you have any thought like this in your head, banish the thought of getting this toy - you will likely be disappointed with either version of it. You will certainly be disappointed on this count if you get the Munchkin version.  On the better, original Embryonics version of this toy, the piano and harp sound reasonably true to their real sound and the flute is recognizable on the higher notes, at least.  The french horn, however, is barely recognizable as a brass instrument, and doesn\\'t have any of the beauty and timbre of sound that a real French horn does.  And the violin - forget it!  It doesn\\'t even sound like a string instrument, and I doubt a child hearing the violin part on this cube and then hearing a real violin would hear any similarity.  On the newer Munchkin version, only the piano sounds like the same family of instrument - kind of like a harpsichord, as one musically-trained reviewer has noted.  The rest of the instruments sound like synthesized crap.  (I suspect that none of this will matter to you in the least if you just want a musical toy your child can interact with in some way, and despite this shortcoming, I think most toddlers would enjoy either version of the toy just because it is plays music and does so in an interactive way. Nonetheless, in this day of tiny, inexpensive high-quality music players, I don\\'t get why they couldn\\'t make this to sound more like real instruments, and to have better sound quality overall.)4) You would like to enjoy this toy with your child, or at least not be driven crazy by it while he is playing with it. As you can tell from what I\\'ve said already, I definitely agree with other reviewers that the newer Munchkin version of this toy has much inferior sound quality than its predecessor.  Not only are the Munchkin instrument sounds largely unrecognizable, but the music overall sounds tinny, with the result that it is really grating to listen to it for any length of time.  And if your kid likes this toy as much as ours does, you will be listening to it a LOT. I think that for this reason alone, it is probably worthwhile to check the listings until you can find the older Embryonics version of the music cube.  Even if you aren\\'t especially musically inclined.  Then again, if your kid already has lots of toys that sing and make noise (mine doesn\\'t), you may have developed the ability to tune out any kind of tinny synthesizer-produced ruckus, in which case you might as well save yourself the trouble of hunting down an Embryonics cube and just get the Munchkin version.Also, it is worth noting that the newer Munchkin version is marginally better-looking, in case that matters to anyone reading this review.  On the Embryonics version, all the sides are a somewhat drab yellow, with only the edges and centers of the cube offering any variety in color, whereas the Munchkin version is more colorful - this is the version pictured in all the product photos.',\n",

If he kicks one of the buttons, that will be enough, but he doesn't really have enough force just from swatting at it (he'd probably have to lean onto it).  It's also too heavy for him to pick up.The music quality is very nice and I don't find it to be at all annoying (like many other electronic baby toys); the flute is probably the nicest sounding of the instruments.

I have to take it away, so what is the point of having a toy that gets forgotten about in a cupboard somewhere?As for good points, there are lots of colors obviously, and baby can choose just one instrument or the whole orchestra sha-bang.  The individual instruments don't REALLY sound authentic, but it was a nice try. The musical arrangement was a nice choice, too.  But please MUNCHKIN, for the sanity of future parents receiving this as a gift, put a volume control on it!!!If you are looking for a great gift for a parent, seriously considerPlayskool Busy Poppin' Pals (Colors May Vary), it's lasted through 3 kids, six years, and still going strong.  It's nice and quiet, too.\",\n",

It's not a minature version of the New York Symphony stuffed into a $600 Bose music player, like some people are expecting.Since this is a child's toy, I think it's serves it's purpose well.  The music is clear.  The lights flash when the music plays.  I think it's neat that you can add or subtract musical instruments during the song that's playing so your baby can hear what each individual instrument sounds like.My daughter loves the toy.  It keeps her occupied for long periods of time and she's learning the names of each instrument and how they each sound both together in an orchestra and individually.The people who are expecting this to be something more than it is need to understand that the toy wasn't designed for their enjoyment.  The toy was designed for children.  And, in my opinion, it's an exceptional toy that will keep most children entertained which, in and of itself, is a blessing.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I hesitated to buy this after reading some of the reviews comparing it to the old Embryonics version. You see, I bought that version at a secondhand store back when my three-year-old was a baby. It was a great toy, but the battery compartment was hard to take off and put on without breaking it. One day we brought it to a friend's house, and someone else's kid somehow broke the battery cover in such a way that my attempts to fix it with super glue were futile. I went back to the secondhand store to find the other one I had seen on my initial visit, but I didn't find it. I was bummed because I had really liked it! I came to Amazon to discover that Munchkin now made the music box, but the reviews comparing the old one to the new one kept me from buying it.A little while ago, I decided I still really missed the toy, and I now had another baby who might enjoy it. Thus I bought it because I figured we could return it if it was really that bad.I honestly think that it is better than the old one! It has nicer colors, an improved battery compartment cover, and better synchronization of the instruments.The Embryonics version was purple and yellow and, in my opinion, kind of ugly. As you can see in the pictures, the Munchkin version is all different colors and visually appealing.The sound quality is just as good, and the batteries get used up a little more slowly in the Munchkin version. The battery compartment cover now has two screws (rather than a screw and a tab that put stress on the cover every time you had to put it back on) plus a pull-out box that contains the three batteries.On the Embryonics version, sometimes the instruments were out of sync. We had this problem from the start. It just seemed that one or two instruments were slightly behind the others. We've used our Munchkin version plenty but haven't yet run into this problem.I'm not sure why some other reviewers are knocking the sound quality (whether or not it's compared to the Embryonics version). This isn't an orchestra; it's a child's toy. It introduces them to some new music plus some musical instruments they might not encounter otherwise. Do the individual instruments sound like the real thing? Kind of. But again, it's a child's toy. The sound quality does tend to suffer as the batteries start to die, but that's to be expected. It gets quieter and flatter, like the instruments are slightly out of tune.I'm generally not a big fan of noise-making toys, especially ones that play music because the music tends to be very annoying. I don't find the music from this box annoying; in fact, it bothered me so little that I sought out this particular toy two years after throwing out the original, broken one.My only complaint is that I wish the box had a lower volume setting. The music can be a little loud, especially when it's got new batteries. That would probably help retain some battery life, too.Overall, my baby loves this toy, and my 3-year-old, who loved it as a baby, still loves it. They actually play with it together, which is rare. The older one recognizes the instruments and likes to show his younger brother what they are.Oh, and if you're like me and hesitated to buy this because it's supposedly crappy compared to the Embryonics version, fret not and just order it. You'll be glad you did, and if you disagree, pack it back up and return it.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I purchased this toy for Christmas for my daughter who was 10 months old at the time and she loved it right away. She happily tapped on the large buttons to hear each instrument and stayed engaged for at least half an hour each time she played with it. Now at almost 16 months old, she has figured out how to play with it more, understanding that she can change the melody to each song and is just starting to realize with true understanding that she can add/remove an instrument to change the song to her liking. I find myself playing with this toy, as do many of my daughter's young playmates and their parents too! Some of her older cousins, who are 7-9yrs old also find enjoyment playing with this toy as well and this just proves the endless possibilities this toy provides as well as many years of extended play. So far, this toy has been dropped quite a bit and it still looks/functions as new as the day I purchased it.I'm also aware that this toy is what many have called a cheaper reproduction of the original that was out many years ago, but the product I received is pretty good too. The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is very engaging and while others have said the music sounds &#34;tinny&#34;, I didn't find that to be the case at all. I'm no music expert, but to my ears, each of the instrumental sounds is clear and pretty to me! I'm sure the original was really great but this one is pretty nice too. I suspect that maybe I received a newer model and the quality has been improved and if that's the case, I HIGHLY recommend the purchase of this toy. The instruments sound lovely, the songs are pleasant and will not annoy you as other toys do, and most of all, this toy is educational because it engages children to think and can be enjoyed for many, many years to come!\",\n",

I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery.

Each song is a classical music track.  When a song is in play you can push the other sides of the cube to add or subtract instruments.  I think this is a fantastic toy that will get toddlers thinking about music.The best part of this toy is quality of the toy.  It is clear that the programmers put a lot of thought into creating it.  The instruments definitely sound true to what they should be.  You can very clearly tell the difference between the sound of the french horn, flute, piano, harp, and violin.  Each of the instruments plays a different part of a song and each instrument is playing a part \"true\" to what the instrument does in a real orchestra.  What I mean by this is that in an orchestra, a tuba doesn\\'t just sound different than a flute, they perform different musical functions.  I love that this cube respects this concept.  The result is that the music is worth listening to and I am always happy when my daughter plays with this toy over other toys with less-pleasing music.I highly recommend this toy.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"My six month old grandchild loves this even though she is still somewhat young to fully appreciate it. This is a great toy for infants and toddlers. Here is why:1. This cube stimulates touch, sight, and sound in a creative way. Each side of the cube has a different instrument and a different color: violin--yellow; harp--pink; french horn--orange; flute--purple; piano--green; orchestra--blue.2. When your child touches a side of the cube, it lights up and the instrument starts playing. Touch a second side, and the second instrument plays in sync with the first one (which is still playing), etc. If you want to hear everything at once, just hit the orchestra button.3. There are no sharp corners. Instead each corner is rounded and has yellow, purple, green and red colors.4. There is an easy on/off switch to conserve battery power when the cube is not in use.5. As the name indicates, the cube plays music from Mozart. I have read the most negative review complaining about the sound and that this cube is not as good as the original Embryonics cube. While I have not heard that cube, I have played Mozart pieces on the piano and also have CDs of various of his works, so I am familiar with his music. For a toddler the quality of the music on this cube is just fine, so don't let that negative review discourage you from buying this product.Bottom line: This is a well made quality toy.Update May 20, 2012: My now 16 month old granddaughter still loves to play with this.\",\n",

I think once he gets more efficient at using the seat this will improve.  The urine guard at the front is also a separate piece just tucked in between the seat and the base, so when my son climbs on, he sometimes knocks it out of place (doesn't guard well then).  I do like that it's a bendable rubber type material so it has some give when he scooches his behind over it.  My dad had to fashion a filler block out of styrofoam attached with packing tape to the back of the seat because our toilet is oval so this potty seat slides back when my son sits down.  The description said it works with round and oval seats.  This is true - it does fit - but slides to the back of the toilet opening so my son's feet don't reach the stool and he gets scared.  With the seat braced to the front it's fine.  Great, colorful graphics!\",\n",

He walked around the house with it when we first got it, but as soon as I put it on the toilet and tried to sit him down on it, it was over. He hates it now. I have 2 complaints: 1.) I like that the cushion is removable, but it's a little TOO removable- they need to put velcro on the bottom or something (which I plan on doing if my son ever uses it), and 2.) I don't know if all our toilet seats are weird shaped or it's a design flaw, but I think there's way too much movement of the seat when it's on the toilet. Part of the problem with my son may be that he's scared of the potty seat's wiggle when it's on the toilet. Nonetheless, I ended up buying a Fisher Price potty seat that goes on the floor as well.\",\n",

This little seat seemed to fit the bill and was cheap enough that I didn\\'t mind buying another seat.Yes, it \"fits\" elongated toilets. But there is nothing to keep it from sliding around on the longer toilet seat underneath it - no clamps, no pegs, no rubber feet, nothing! Every time my daughter tried to sit down, the seat would slide 4 inches backwards - landing her on the pee guard. If I start with the little seat as far back as possible, it\\'s too far for her to get on without help (she\\'s nearly 3!) and once on, her feet don\\'t touch her fairly tall step stool. It needs to be at the front of the toilet seat but it won\\'t stay there. So I have to be with her to hold it in place so she can climb on. Not a problem if you are starting out - you need to be with your child - but this is a problem if your child knows how to use the potty and wants to express her independence and \"do it herself\".Once she is sitting with the seat in the proper place, the biggest complaint starts. This thing collects pee. The little pee guard is pointless. From what I\\'ve seen pee guards are needed by some kids, not by others - regardless of sex. My daughter needs one - a decent one. This one just deflects her pee all over the seat, the floor, her pants, her shoes. In short, a drippy, nasty mess that has to be cleaned every time it is used with extra laundry. I shudder to think of the muck that is accumulating in the foam under the vinyl.She wanted one with handles. Fine. I\\'ve added two simple drawer pull knobs to our Primo Ducka potty seat.

This fails for two basic reasons:1) It slides backwards on the toilet seat making it unstable and hard for my daughters to sit down. This is an enormous design flaw.2) The pee guard is basically flush with the seat, so what is its purpose other than to decrease the actual potty-business real estate? It takes away room for daughters' pee to go down. And it's not high enough to save my baby boy from getting soaked when my daughter didn't clamp her knees shut tightly enough to prevent her pee from shooting cleanly over the guard and onto baby's head. He was not pleased. Neither was I.I also have a two mini-potties, the Fisher Price froggy and singing ducky. The pee guard on the froggy potty is great. I love this low-tech seat as it's easy to clean and hands down my twin daughters' favorite. The singing duck potty was more expensive, is much harder to clean, is annoyingly loud and wakes up the baby, and there are a lot more spills due to the lack of pee guard.

       "  'reviewText': \"We had a seat SORT OF like this when my son was training - and lost it.  Not sure if it was the same manufacturer or not.  It had no handles then, and the pee guard stood up high and was removable.  We never used the pee guard, it made it harder to get on the seat and it just wasn't needed - we just taught my son to point it down.Now I am training twin girls and thinking Elmo might get one of them on the potty more (one shows way more interest than the other - it's the reluctant one I want to bribe)  We have little potties with inserts that come off but most parents know the power of Elmo - I'm willing to try anything at this point, within reason.  (ie the all-out free standing elmo potty is too much, LOL, and I want to take advantage of the fact that both are willing to use the big potty with an insert)The reviews about the pee guard on this were so puzzling I had to see it in person before buying it - and it looks TERRIBLE.  It's a very low pee guard.  Basically too low to serve any purpose for a boy, but it's there, and it's high enough that boy or girl I can see them peeing on it and making more of a mess than if it wasn't there.  (One of my girls likes to look down and kind of shift her stuff forward as she pees - not normally a problem, but with this in the way, it would be)  And it does not come off.  I actually stood there in the store contemplating if we could cut it out somehow, maybe with a dremmel, but you shouldn't have to make modifications to a potty ring.  It's one of the worst designs I can imagine.  It's like I can kind of see what they were thinking but they should have thought harder.  So I decided to skip this.  Even if we were to have marginal success with it, I am pregnant with another boy now, and I refuse to buy something I know he won't be able to use.I am really kicking myself for not replacing my son's potty ring when we lost it, but he was doing well enough without it and I never saw it becoming a hard to find item.  No handles made it easier to travel with.  We kept it in our diaper bag.  Now I am in the market for a used potty ring!\",\n",

The doctor recommended that she sits twice a day for ten minutes in a row in the potty, and we decided to buy this toilet seat.Well, two weeks using it and we are finally making progress!! She LOVES her Dora, super pink, flowery potty, so sitting on it is a delight. We were using the potty before, but I thought if we were going to train her for good, it was better to train her in the toilet. And it is very difficult without a toilet seat, because she is not stable.The handles are great, toddlers use them all the time. And the size is just right. Very sturdy and easy to clean (you can separate the cushion from the plastic, to clean separately). My toilet is not exactly the same shape (the potty seat is somewhat rounder), but it is sturdy enough so it is not a problem.We love it and I highly recommend it. There are other designs for boys as well, but the pink Dora one is great for girls this age.',\n",

It just rests in the hole of the toilet seat and slides around a bit.  When lifting my daughter off of the seat, her legs stick to it, it goes up with her and then falls back onto the toilet.  She isn't scared too much by that since it is lightweight, but I would think that to be terrifying for a 23 month old just starting to use a big, scary toilet.It seems comfortable enough and my daughter was willing to sit on it for about 5 minutes straight on the first try.  Since she loves Dora so much, she really liked this potty seat, however, I can see that being a problem:  I may find the potty seat in random places throughout the house since she'll want to play with it!  Something I hadn't thought of!Being as lightweight as it is, it's easy for myself or even my daughter (once she learns how) to put it on the toilet very easily.I really do not want a separate potty seat to have to clean so was looking for something like this.Overall, serves its purpose for the low price I paid for it.In hindsight, I would have just payed double this price for the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer (29.99 with free shipping here on amazon.com!) that adjusts to fit ALL toilet seats snugly.  The reviews were raving on that one!Good luck fellow potty trainers!\",\n",

I will not fix it now since I'm sure I'll have more to fix later.  I like this gate because it has two point of contact in the locked and closed position.  Both rails the upper and lower fit about 1 1/2 inch into a metal seat.  This makes it so secure.  I don't agree w/ the other reviewers that said the lower rail pops out, I'm sure if it was installed WRONG.  Just make sure to measure properly and make sure things are even, level and line up and there is NO way the rail is going to pop out!  I did pinch myself a few times opening this the first few times.  You have to slide the rail in a bit to swing it and there's a metal piece on the top rail that supports the two gates, ouch.

       "  'reviewText': 'We purchased this gate almost 2 years ago when my daughter started crawling.  She\\'s now 2 1/2 years old.  I\\'ve been meaning to write a review on this gate since it is one of the best gates for the stairs.  We have mounted it at the top of the stair.  My husband used small pieces of 2x4\\'s for extra security to mount it on the side of the stairs that has plaster (as opposed to a wooden post).  This gate is very strong and is holding up very well (minus the fingerprints :).  A few times, I have caught my daughter standing at it shaking it or trying to stand on it, which I make her stop. Fortunately, there are no vertical bars, just horizontal, so climbing it would be a little difficult.  I\\'d done quite a bit of research on baby gates before purchasing this one at Babies R Us, but in trying to save a few dollars, I first went to Wal-Mart and bought a metal top-of-the-stairs gate, but I decided to take it back since it had a raised \"platform\" (for lack of a better word) piece at the bottom.  I think that platform was meant for extra sturdiness, but I saw it as an accident waiting to happen.  I returned that gate before we even installed it.  This gate doesn\\'t have that \"platform\" and it is still very sturdy.  Another nice feature about this is that you can just slip the gate out of its brackets to remove it if you are having a party or have to run up and down the stairs without needing to swing the gate out of your way.  And when you are ready to put it back, just line the gate up with the brackets and slide it in place.  Really nice feature for us when we were moving our daughter\\'s furniture from one room to the other and downstairs, we didn\\'t have the gate in our way since we removed the swing arm.  Overall, we are very pleased and would buy this gate again if we had to.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This gate could have easily been 5 stars, but there are a few points that need mention, where the gate needs some improvement.  If \\'Evenflo\\' addresses these, this gate will easily merit a top score.  Let me start with the positives.  The gate itself is made of sturdy and aesthetically appealing wood.  It works well and looks great, IF the install goes well, and as EXACTLY specified (included paper template is great).  The mechanical \\'lock latch\\' inspires confidence in that you can actually feel and hear it \\'click into place\\', which gives one peace of mind.  Of course, one hopes that \\'Evenflo\\' has determined this type of latch to be one that is not \\'easily defeated\\' by the age group that it was manufactured/intended for (6 months to 2 years)!  Thankfully, it does seem like it is up to the task.  I also like the fact that the bottom latch receptacle allows for the gate to slide into, thus adding reinforcement to BOTH the top and bottom portions of this gate.  Way to go \\'Evenflo\\'!  The negatives about the gate are as follows. In many typical installations, there will be baseboard molding/trim that may get in the way of installing the bottom-most latch receptacle. It did in my case, even after carefully measuring the proper clearance from the floor, as specified in the assembly directions.  Thus, I wasn\\'t able to get the latch receptacle to clear the molding in order to screw in the bottom screw.  I had to thus cut (with a hacksaw) that portion of the latch receptacle, and \\'modify\\' it for my installation.  I then was only able to use 1 screw (although a larger and longer one than provided), instead of 2, to install the bottom latch receptacle.  Thankfully, even just the modified 1 screw installation was very tight and secure going into the door jam wood.  \\'Evenflo\\' should provide the consumer with at least another type of bottom latch receptacle that allows for better clearance of molding near the floor.  Besides, MOST typical homes DO have some kind of baseboard molding, and mine was only 1/1/2\" high, hardly anything large.  Lastly, the assembly directions did not make clear which latch receptacle to use on the top, and which on the bottom.  They are NOT the same dimensions, as one is thicker than the other (top latch receptacle is thinner than the thicker bottom one).  Of course, the aforementioned \\'latch receptacle\\' install challenge may not even apply to you for your installation, especially if you don\\'t have floor baseboard molding.  In summation, this gate is STURDY and EXCELLENT, and a good value.  PLEASE, just make sure you do install it correctly (as per the instructions), and NEVER leave your baby alone unsupervised.  These gates are meant to be used WITH proper supervision, and never as a replacement for.',\n",

A small child would not be able to do it on his or her own though.  The gate's design ensures that little climbers will not be able to get a lift.

Then, when it's unlocked, it slides for adjustment. The thing is, there is no way to stop it so baby sticks his arm through slates as you open and then you have a broken or badly bruised arm. We put a screw into the wood so it would slide just a little to help prevent that. IF we had known about the second risk, we would have just taken it down then. THe next morning, it was kid tested. Yeah, all the kid has to do is push the bottom and it comes out of the bracket causing the gate bend foreward. So far, I have seen my kids push it more than a foot out of position. MAJOR STRANGLATION HAZARD. Not to mention broken bones. The wood is so flimsy it just twist every which way.As far as function goes, when you go to unlock it, sometimes it will not unhook out of the slot. I have had to pratically hang on it to get it open. Also, the gate now leans. When opened, it leans to where a ball would roll for the from to the end of the gate. Not sure how that came about. We have had this gate for a couple of months. My son has been able to push it out since he started crawling. My 2 yrold can almost squeeze out by pushing on it which has lead to her getting stuck when I made a bathroom break. Not a good gate at all. Evenflo just needs to stop. Every product I have had has been crap. I am afraid to buy their carseats. If they can't make a good simple baby gate, I wouldn't trust my child's life to their carseats. We plan to replace within the next couple of paychecks.\",\n",

With hard tile at the bottom of the stairs, a tumble would be bad.  I wanted a gate at the bottom of the stairs, but not an eyesore that was in the way all the time when not in use.We tried the soft and wide gate and another pressure-mounted gate, but those are a pain...  it takes a lot of time to get them in place securely (kids are rough and can knock or pull them down easily) and then if you want to go up the stairs once you have it in place, you have to climb over it all the time!  Not practical...What I love about this gate is that it slides right off of the hinges and stores away in the closet when not in use!  The wall-mounted parts are very small and hardly noticeable when the gate is stored away.

I have been satisfied with the results, but it isn\\'t the greatest quality. Installation was quite simple, and once the gate locks in it is quite secure. However, the unlatching mechanism for the gate can be tricky at times. My whole family has had problems opening the gate at one point or the other. Sometimes when it unlatches, it can pinch your fingers, and you have to get both the top and bottom of the gate in the correct angle, or else it won\\'t open. The same problem arises when closing. You have to make sure the two openings are aligned, or else the gate won\\'t lock properly. I find myself double checking constantly to make sure the top and bottom have both \"clicked\" into their respective spot because it doesn\\'t always on first try. We purchased the First Years Hands Free gate for a different room (not a stairway) and it works GREAT. So simple, easy to install, and very secure. I have found that the metal gates work much better than the wood ones, not only from experience at my house, but at other friends as well. It is worth the money to invest in a better quality gate if you can afford it.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Update: 6-months later - the sliding mechanism has loosened up considerably with use.  It now slides smoothly without pinching our hands.  I've found the gate to be strong and secure - it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it.  So, if you buy it, try rubbing some wax, or something, on it to help in the beginning, because it was pretty dangerous at first.  And also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you're opening it. That will happen with any slotted, sliding gate.  Some further negatives I found is that the latch is loud, and it's also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands.  And with it being difficult for her to do, she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying.  I'm always afraid she's going to wake the kids.  So, if you have your mom at your house a lot, get something easier.  It will save a lot of frustration - for both of you!-----I've had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it.  What happens is when you unlatch it, you first have to slide the gate in, then swing it out.  There are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together, and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract (look at the photo - you'll see what I mean).  The sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do.  I'm sure with use it will loosen, or perhaps I can put some wax on there.  But when you're opening the gate in a rush, as I did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and I needed to run upstairs to shut the windows, I put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide, and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket.  The first time I did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and I wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby.  My hand got pinched under that metal part and I thought to myself that I need to be more careful. But busy parents like us don't have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate.  When we've got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows, the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a SAFETY gate!! I dont' mean to beat a dead horse, but seriously, that's not good.  The pinch I got today was major painful - I've got a blood blister that's almost half an inch long!\",\n",

I was always concerned my daughter would fall down the steps if the gate gave way because she would pull herself up on it. These gates I know they are locked and they are much sturdier. I like that they slide back and forth; it's easier to get through entries.We used wood that matched our stair case so that we didn't have to drill into the post of our railing.

OF COURSE, I wouldn't leave her alone in it. She is pretty active - not walking yet - but she loves to climb. I don't think she could ever climb out of it, but I'm not going to chance it.We haven't had any problems with it... safety or otherwise... I started to buy the mini mastreo walker but was turned off by some of the reviews. The main reason I bought this one is, reviews on that one were mostly displeased with how hard it was to turn. This one is very easy to turn. My girl spins in circles, even on the carpet and on our wood deck!Yes, it is bulky, but have you seen a walker that's not? They have to be so that they can't be tipped over! The only problem I have with it is... there is not a volume switch. It is not too loud, but when you've had a rough day and have a nice headache to prove it - keep them away from this toy!\",\n",

We really didn't notice any pros or cons to this particular walker over others.The main problem that we've run into with both of our daughters is the fact that that they really enjoyed the toys for about 1 month at the maximum.  After that they got bored and soon started fussing to get out and roll around on the floor.Our first daughter used the walker part of it for almost a week before again getting tired of it as the fact is, something along these lines is just too tough for a little one to control by themselves.  If you can imagine pushing a shopping cart that wants to go it's own way that's the way it is with the walker.  It's too big and bulky for them to easily steer not to mention the fact that little ones often don't realize what steering is.  The only know walk forward and crawl away when they can't move forward anymore.  With that said, understand that you'll have to walk with them to help them steer.Overall I remain convinced that a walker is good for kids to have so they have something other than their parent to hold onto to learn to walk but be prepared to help them walk in it because of the above mentioned bulkiness of the walker and the fact that I've never come across any walker from any company that's been easy enough for a little one to steer and push at the same time.5 stars for the idea and the toys but I had to take 1 star away for the difficulty to steer and another star for the limited time that my daughters used it.\",\n",

I love how much room it has compared to the standard size pack and plays.Like the other pack and plays this is easy to fold up and store against the wall. I hav to do so every night since I live in a smaller house and have a cat that might like to jump in it while we are sleeping and make it his new nap spot.The colors are vibrant and have kept my now 13 month old interested and intrigued. She loves to play with the butterfly wings and hit the squeaky toy. It is a generous size without taking up too much room on the floor. I like that there is more space for kids and their toys. She has fallen asleep in it many times.Not recommended but I have sat in it with her and it is very sturdy, It is very level.  I have had this for about 9 months now and it still looks like new. I think for the size it is highly recommended. I trust the Graco name too.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I love this nice, big playpen.  Lots of room to practice/learn crawling.  Lots of things to look at: primary colors and geometric shapes and things on the side to play with.  Mat wipes clean and doesn\\'t absorb fluids (pee, drool, drinks; you just wipe them up, don\\'t need to wait for mat to dry or anything).  It\\'s very sturdy and easy to put together AND the latches latch very easily.  I think it\\'s rated up to 30lbs (or when the child can climb out, of course).Potential drawbacks:-Takes up lots of floor space (worth it to me for the extra crawling room).-It has built in noise-making toys on walls: a crinkle wing butterfly & a rattle bumblebee. Neither are very loud, but still, they aren\\'t detachable & might bother some people.  It also has a louder squeaky toy built into the ladybug on one side but I don\\'t think a child could squeak it on their own; in fact my preschooler knows how and isn\\'t strong enough to compress it enough to produce a squeak.  It has to be squeezed from both sides--so maybe if the ladybug was up against a wall the child could press the ladybug into the wall and squeak it, but that\\'s easily solved by putting the ladybug facing out.-Mirror is up too high to be seen by a baby until the child can sit up on their own.-Once it\\'s assembled it\\'s not simple to move.  Apart from the four corner feet, there are four support feet (for a total of 8 feet) and no wheels on any of them. (But many of the wheeled playpens are so difficult to navigate that you don\\'t move them much either.)-It\\'s surprising how MUCH it stands out in a regular room--so big and so brightly colorful, it is not going to blend in to most adult decor AT ALL.  I think it also comes in black, though.  The black one may not have the noise-making built-ins, I\\'m not sure.None of the potential drawbacks bothered me much, but they were a bit of a surprise.  I\\'m still very happy--it\\'s easy to assemble and is one of the bigger portable playpens available.  As a bonus it comes in a large box AKA \"toy\" for other youngsters. ;-)UPDATE:  We\\'ve been using it for 6 months now and LOVE IT!  We have an always moving one year old baby.  The high walls keep him from climbing out, the extra supporting legs handle it when he jumps, falls or flops down with all his might.  The built in toys on the walls are still in great shape (I\\'m still the only one who can make the ladybug squeak).  It is just so nice to have a play pen big enough for him to actually PLAY in.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'m a grandma and this is the shape of playpen that was in use when my children were babies except that they were a bit larger (about 42\" square play area vs the current 36\" square play area). I find this shape to be less confining than the usual playpens now available that are basically the same thing as putting the baby in a bed.Playpens weren\\'t this cute back then, but every bit as handy. It is not only a perfectly safe and controlled area in which babies can learn to play and quietly make sense of their world, but it provides great peace of mind for parents and grandparents to be able to put the baby down in a safe place while talking on the phone or doing something that does not allow for hands-on and undivided supervision. This unit is well built, stable, portable, and easy to fold (once you get the hang of it, it\\'s not exactly intuitive).How could it be better? I would like the padding to be a little bit thicker, I would like the play area to be a little bit larger (so two babies could play there comfortably, like in the \"old\" days), and I would like a removable and washable cover to the pad instead of having to make my own.But, this review is based on it being the best that is available now and it living up fully to the product description.',\n",

This exceeded my expectations for a travel crib.This is the perfect balance between being spacious enough for an active tot without taking up your entire living room.  I like that it is self contained (i.e. has a base that sits above the floor) and that it has some built-in toys.  It also is very easy to fold and unfold.  We bought a Graco Travel Lite portacrib for my daughter when she was three months old for traveling with and while it was great when we could use it as a bassinet, as soon as we put her down in the crib section she HATED it (tough \"mattress\", very small - but exceptionally light &lt;20 lbs).We usually stay somewhere that has a crib, but if we took a car trip I would definitely bring this with both for sleeping and playing.I agree with the other reviewers that I wish this came with a sheet (or that Graco even made a sheet for this).  That being said, it only took me about 10 minutes to make a fitted sheet for this on my sewing machine (it looks something like a large European pillow case).',\n",

It's a very nice size and fits a good deal of toys, though if the room is small it does take up a lot of space. Baby loves the bug toys on the sides. She's just learning to sit on her own and I was very pleased to see when she fell back she did not cry - the floor pad is thick and soft so it cushioned her head. I like that because she did fall backwards once in her gym (placed on the carpet) and was very upset. With this I know if she falls back she won't get hurt.

I had a pack n play from graco with the changing table attached.  I basically have it solely for that purpose - the changing table. With the holidays coming and some overnight stays expected, I wanted one that was easy to put together and fold up and go QUICKLY.  I read numerous reviews on Amazon on several pack n plays.  I kept coming back to this one mostly b/c of the bright colors. I was basically sold when I read one review that stated a 14 year old put this together in less than a minute.  NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!  I'm a single mom and have absolutely no patience for something that is complicated.  My mom and I put the graco pack n play with the changing table together and it was very difficult. I think it took over an hour to put together with another person.  The review I read was dead on.  I took the totbloc pack n play out of the box and had it together within 2 minutes.  My 9 month old baby loves it.  it is VERY ROOMY inside.  She has not slept in it yet since I only got it today.  The bottom is fairly quilted and I don't think she will have a problem with napping in it.  She loves the bugs on the 4 sides too.  The bright colors are great.  I'm sure we will be using this for a long time.\",\n",

I took Clorox Spray anywhere and cleaned the mat, the bugs & the top rails. It wiped right off & the fabric wasn\\'t even wet, it is sort of water resistant.I started putting both my twins in here before they could sit up on their own. I also always put extra toys in there for them which they love. I used to keep this set up in our living room but now we keep it in our van to use when we visit people. It is so easy to set up and tear down and my girls love playing in it. I think we\\'ll be able to use this for a long time. Both my girls are 11 months old right now and can pull themselves up just enough to chew on the top rails.So if you\\'re looking for something to use with twins, definately buy this.

       "  'reviewText': \"Fantastic product. Our child loves playing in this pack 'n play. Even if we don't put toys inside the walls are moderately entertaining for our child. The sun has a mirror (plastic kind that sort of warps images), the butterfly has crinkly wings (fabric with plastic inside for noise), another side has a bug with wings inside and the final side has a squeaker (which is really hard to use).It's all one piece so no &#34;assembly&#34; ever required. The sides are collapsible with the push of a button on each side. The ground mat that the child sits on servers as the exterior of the case that holds the pole-assembly together when folded up. And there's a light-plastic zipper bag with handle that serves as a carrying case. It packs up into a long rectangle, probably 1x1x8 feet.Pros:- Pack up or unpack in under a minute, no &#34;assembly&#34; required just set it and lock it into place like a collapsible baby stroller.- Sturdy build, child won't be able to tip it over and it would never fold on itself.- Soft but strong mesh walls that child can see through but can't stick fingers or small objects through mesh.Cons:- This is a minor complaint: the squeaker on one of the walls is impossible for a child to squeak - you have to press it from both sides of the wall because it's sewn so tightly- As a side-effect of the sturdiness it's very heavy. On the plus side of that, it is made of sturdy materials.\",\n",

It was kind of funny for about 90 seconds, then we had to read the instructions, which, it turns out, work. The only tricky part is the release button being hidden inside the four top bars under the fabric. I kept trying to squeeze it but there is a button on the underside that has to be pushed up into the handle. This pack n' play feels plenty sturdy to me. It's nice that it has a carrying case with strap. We used this as a place to stash twin babies at home when they were too small for bouncy chairs and swings and such. They got their tummy time and social time in it, although the pad is a bit slick for them to try to push with their feet to turn over, so a towel helps. We also use it as a pack n' play when traveling for them to sleep in. I wish it was just a bit smaller when folded, as I thought it would fit on the floor of the passenger seat, but it has to go in the trunk.\",\n",

I think it is soft enough for naps and play time though. My 8 month old played in there last night and scooted his bottom around in there and played with the toys for about an hour. This is a larger playpen that would be hard to move from room to room. IT is 3 feet by 3 feet w/ no wheels on the bottom. I have it set up in the corner of the living room where I will keep it.

But I've noticed that she does get a bit overstimulated with all the pictures on the bottom and her toys actually get lost on the mat because they blend in with it.Pros: it's easy to put together and take apart, it's relatively light, it's colorful, has built in toys, and is stable.Cons: the base of the play yard slopes inward, makes it hard for my baby to crawl and flip over and all her toys roll right into the center. I sort of fixed that by putting something under the center leg. The other negatives are that it's too colorful on the bottom and has too many pictures so the toys blend in. Also, it's not PVC, phthalate free. I emailed the company and asked them about chemical fire retardants. I don't know if anyone cares, but the foam mattress IS treated with chemicals - chlorinated tris. It was banned in baby clothes by the FDA, and is banned in Europe because it's cancerous. Since the cover of it is porous and is not waterproof, I feel like the chemical can easily get in my daughter's lungs, especially since she loves to suck on fabric. So I sent the yard back. I'll be buying a Joovy, they don't use chemical fire retardants. That was actually the biggest drawback for me.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Graco Tot Block with Bugs is a pack and play that features figures of bugs on each of the sides for added fun. Kids enjoy playing with the bugs and each offers something slightly different. The bee has its two wings extended inside of the playpen and the wings make a rattling noise when moved. The butterfly's wings are also extended inside the playpen and they offer the sound of paper being crinkled. The ladybug has a squeak toy inside its body to create its own unique sound and the sun has a mirror for a child's enjoyment. Each offers its own type of stimulation and since they are built in, they are always there. There is no need to worry that the toys will be lost.Besides the toys, the other reason kid's love the Graco Tot Block with Bugs is for its bright colors. Most playpens are dark blue or dark green in color and offer nothing that is visually appealing. This pack and play, however, offers combinations of bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Babies seem more entranced with this playpen than with the plain colored playpens. They like looking at the bright colors and playing with the interactive, built- in toys on the sides of the playpen.Like other pack and plays, Graco Tot Block folds up for easy storage. You need to remove the pad from the inside before you fold the unit because the pad acts as a cover for the rest of the playpen. Once you have the playpen folded, it slips inside of the pad using Velcro straps to secure it in place. Once the pad has been wrapped, the entire unit then slips into a plastic bag with a zipper to keep it shut. This is simple enough, but I have noticed that this pack and play weighs a little more than others and it is also a little more awkward to remove and set up. It helps to have a second person to open it up and prepare it for use. But this is only a minor inconvenience because it can still be set up with little effort.With all of the stimulation offered with this playpen, there is one possible disadvantage: It could keep your child from falling asleep. If your goal for buying this playpen is strictly to have a place for your youngster to play, then the added stimulation will be an asset. But if you want to place your child in the playpen for a quick nap, you might have some difficulty due to the attention- grabbing colors and interactive toys. These toys cannot be removed from the walls of the playpen so they could definitely create a distraction that could prevent some kids from falling asleep.Graco recommends this playpen for smaller kids up to approximately two years of age. If your child is older, then you should not use this playpen because he/she might be able to climb out. Most kids age two or under, however, will be small enough to use this playpen. Also, even though there is no defined limit for the number of kids who can play inside this device, I think it should be limited to two. Any more than two and the kids will begin to get frustrated with the constant bumping into each other.Overall, this is a very good pack and play from Graco and it ranks among my child's favorite playpens. The colors and interactive, built in toys make it a favorite among all kids and while it does weigh a little more than other pack and plays and does require more effort to unpack and set up, it still makes a good choice for parents of small children. The interactive toys can't get lost and the unit's bright colors make it appealing to children and adults alike.\",\n",

Everything goes into his mouth - dust bunnies, little scraps of paper my other two kids overlooked when they cleaned up after playing with paper, anything. I'm worried he will eventually find a little toy like a Squinkie, or something will fall off of a counter, and he will get it. He also pulls the kitchen chairs over on him, so we have them bungie corded to the table legs. Of course we will still give him supervised time to roam, but we needed him to have a safe place to go other than his excersaucer. Now that he crawls and cruises he is not content in his excersaucer for more than a couple of minutes. He would much rather play UNDER the excersaucer. We let him check out the playpen from the outside before we put him inside so he would be intrigued. So far he likes it. He is able to cruise in the playpen and gum the top rail. I purchased some new toys to put in it too so he will have something new to play with in there.Each of the sides has a toy on the mesh. I've checked out two of the sides. One crinkles when it is touched and another is a mirror. They seem to each have elements that are popular in baby toys.I also got another of the same playpen for my parents house. They have a dog that chews his toys (and the baby's) to bits. And their floor is not clean enough for a baby to crawl on.The playpen sets up and folds down just like the smaller Pack and Plays. It is essentially the same thing. It is a square as wide as the longest side of the Pack and Play.\",\n",

It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags. Only three parts, just the frame, the folding padded floor, and the carrying bag.  It is roomy, has plenty of padding, and has 9 legs for a strong and even base.  It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market.\",\n",

Our baby tries to roll over and always rolls back into the center where it is low.  One time she rolled to the center placing her head lower than her feet.  This scared me so I feel we can only use it when we are sitting right beside the playpen watching her. January 2013.  We are still using this playpen and it has held up well.

I do not have a child but I watch my nephew very frequently (every other weekend). I wanted something that could be both a place to sleep and a place to play. With its bright colors and toys built in my nephews face turned to smiles. He is so comfortable that when he is done playing and tired he will put his head down to sleep. He loves the rattle butterfly and the crinkle butterfly. He plays with the toys on the pack n play more then the toys in the pack in play. Set up was a breeze. Before buying this pack n play we borrowed my brothers. What a pain to put together and take apart. Sometimes all the sides did not lock and you had to start all over. And take down, you prayed before you start that all the pieces snap apart and it will take you less then 20 minutes. With this pack n play it takes a minute, parts snap and unsnap quickly it is the true pack n play. The bag is a little cheaply made then other bags I've seen but fits perfectly. The padding on the bottom of the pack n play is thicker then others I have seen. It is larger then other pack n plays so you will have a hard time finding bedding and sheets that fit it properly.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"If you're like me you may have gone back and forth between this Graco and the Delta (Novel) playard. I ended up buying them both for my twins and here is the comparison.Ease of setup--they both take about a minute to put up. The graco was slightly easier to push the middle down that pops it all I to place.Weight & sturdiness--the graco feels lighter than the Delta (a good 5 lbs+), but the Delta feels a bit sturdier when set up, and seems slightly more durable.Shape--the graco is very squared off, and the Delta is square on bottom but curves inward as it goes up so the top railings are in a more round shape. This feels like its saving some space even though the dimensions are the same.Mattress--the graco has a very bright, colorful mattress pad with squares and bugs on it. It has a decent thickness in terms of padding for the baby to be comfortable. The pad also lays flat, but you do get a slight dip in the middle after a baby has been in there for a while. The Delta has a colorful mattress pad but with 'gentler' tones of color featuring the animals on the mesh sides. The padding is not as thick feeling as the graco, but the pad itself is more water and stain proof of a material than the graco. Even though it's not as padded feeling it feels sturdier. No dip in the middle, and I would feel a bit more comfortable with more weight in the Delta.Mesh---they both seem to have equally durable mesh. The graco has built in toys on each side of the mesh; whereas the Delta has the animals printed on the mesh.Price--the graco is more expensive than the Delta.All in all they are both nice. I think the better one depends on what you are planning on using it for. If it's going to be up all the time at your house or daycare, etc. I think the Delta is built sturdier and will be more durable with continued daily use. If you are using it to bring around with you places (hotel, camping, on the back deck, grandma's, etc). then I would go for the Graco because it is much lighter to lug around, and has built in toys so if you forget to bring some there is still toys for baby to play with. The graco also seems sturdy and durable; the Delta just seems a bit better in those departments; that's all.The 3ft by 3ft size is amazing!!  Wish I had bought one sooner!  We have twins and they both can play in one together without them feeling like they are on top of each other.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I purchased this square playpen for an 8 month and 18 month old (not at the same time of course).  I have purchased a few pack n plays rectangular and a few of these square playpens.  You would think they are the same, but they are not.  The pack n plays are great for naps, (I would say 18 months and younger), and easy to transport and some come with a bassinet for babies.  I have used those strictly for naps, as they are not that stable or large enough for play.  This square playpen is ideal!!!  It is so sturdy.  Easy to set up, take down.  Perfect for when you need to get something done.  It keeps those walking and crawling confined, but still gives plenty of space for them and a few of their toys.  The 18 month child seems perfectly content playing and falling asleep in it, whereas the pack n play, he hated it.  Couldn't stand up without falling down.Gives you the much needed break so you can get things done.  Since this is for short terms during the day and I give him some toys, he doesn't mind it.  Then I put him in a portable crib for sleeping.  In my honest opinion, the square playpen is much better for him and safer than the portable crib, but foster services states you have to have a crib, not playard for sleeping.  I feel much more comfortable having the child in the playpen than the crib.He also likes the bright colors.  It is a little heavier than the pack n plays rectangular.  It is not something I would take along where I had to carry it very far.  But it does pack up the same as the pack n plays, and you could transport it to a grandparents house, or babysitter, or the park.  Just a little heavier and larger than the pack n plays.  This has been a lifesaver!!  In my opinion, works better than using those portable plastic pens.  I tried that, didn't last long.  Wouldn't go back to that, and have no problems recommending these square playpens.The ones I purchased came with a thick padded mat.  It is very substantial and seems to work fine.  However, I guess you could add padding underneath if you needed to.This is perfect if you wanted something for a grandparents house, it could be used for play or sleeping and then easily stored away taking little room.  These square ones do not have wheels, so if you needed something really portable, you might want the rectangular.  If you are using for both play and sleep, I would suggest limiting the time the child is in the pen, so they see that as more of a rest area than confinement.\",\n",

Well.......it's so nicely colored, screams cuteness all over, and it's very easy to set up and take down. I also love how spacious it is and I have fun playing peek-a-boo with my little one too! They say mothers know best..... and in my case.... that was true! Buy it, you won't regret it.\",\n",

I wanted something larger for my baby to play in, and the Graco TotBloc definitely delivers.  That being said, this pack n play stinks as a napping or travel crib.  It's large, bulky, the foam bottom is thin and not very comfy for baby to sleep on, and there is no mattress option for a pack n play this size!  I took this on a trip last weekend and put the baby in there with a blanket on the bottom so she wasn't uncomfortable. Every time she rolled around, it would make the rattle toy attached to the walls of the pack n play move. It actually woke her up, and it was a long night. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone wanting this to double as a napping crib.If I had to do it all over again, I would have gone with the Joovy like I originally planned.\",\n",

She can see us, we can talk with her, and she has plenty of room to practice pulling herself up and walking along the edges (and falling on her bum on the padded floor). When she was younger, she loved playing with the attached toys (especially the butterfly with the crinkly wings).It's sturdy, easy to set up and take down, and packs away neatly into its carrying case.

My parents have a Cosco playyard that they borrowed from a friend for when we visit.  Theirs is about half the size and seems almost as heavy.-The square shape on the TotBloc is nice, too because he can move around a bit in there and actually get somewhere instead of just rolling over once and hitting the end.-There is no listed weight limit on this, only a height limit.

It is the standard length of a traditional playpen, but the width is the same as well which gives babies much more space to crawl around in and play than the typical playard.  It is very simple to put up and take down.  My baby has only slept in it one night and it was fine for her.  It is very sturdy and the bottom mat has tabs that snap into the base of the frame for extra stability. The colors are bright which is good for the baby but doesn't exactly fit into my home decor. The sides each have a toy- a mirror, two rattle butterflies and one squeek lady bug.  The squeek is really hard to press so I often hold my hand on one side of the pen for stability and press on the other side but that is only an extra feature so I'm not really disappointed.  This is the most affordable by far of the larger size playpens and I'm very happy with my choice.\",\n",

It means I can go to the bathroom in peace and get some chores done knowing she is safe and amused.It is super easy to put together - it literally takes less than a minute - take out of the box - unfold it and it clicks into place. The pictures on the side are of good quality and my daughter likes to pull and play with them.We also have a weekend home - so bought two of these. I would guess this could also double as a crib for the weekend house - ie - for a night or two at a time.Highly recommend for the 7 - 10 month phase of baby's development.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Let me start by saying that this is very colorful and attractive to baby.  The base is also attractive with lots of colors for baby to 'discover'.There is a play thing on each side - crinkly butterfly, mirror, squeezy sound making ladybug, and rattly bee.  It's large - about 38in square so you'll need some room to place it.  The flipside is that baby has plenty of room to play.  You can store baby's toys in there and still they space to play.It has mesh sides for airflow and so that parents can see in and babies can see out.  It's relatively quick to fold away for travel due to a button on each top arm which 'folds' that side.  A very neat idea.  However, that's where the good stuff ends because there are two major flaws with this product.Why do manufactuers insist on producing fabric based items for a baby that cannot be WASHED ???  Why oh why do they not make the fabric removable - do they not know that kids make a MESS ???  Duh !!!  How is one supposed to remove spit-up and drool (and possibly worse!)?It's perhaps the most important thing in any piece of baby equipment; be it a chair, car seat, pushchair, crib, or playpen.  THE FABRIC SHOULD BE REMOVABLE FOR WASHING.The second issue is that the base pad is only about 3/4 in thick.  That in itself is not so much of an issue as the fact that when it's placed inside the playpen, it 'dips' in the middle - by about 1/2in.  The centre strut /leg that holds the pad sems to be lower than the other legs  causing a dip in the middle (and yes it's on a flat surface).  Although baby hasn't yet 'rolled' into the center, it's not very comforting knowing that the center is not flat.  Perhaps the pad should have been thicker - better yet the center leg should have been the same size as the others.For what we paid, I don't think it's worth the money - especially considering that the pad can't be cleaned without using chmical cleaners (which we don't intend to use around baby).\",\n",

Best of all, and unlike most play yards, it's FUN; my girl could spend an hour just batting at the colorful bugs on the walls (all make sounds) and floor or giggling at herself in the built-in mirror.

When my son was a little baby, we pulled out the mat and hooked up the toy dangler and he was amazed for hours. My son is now 14 months old and we recently took a 3 day vacation and took it along. We set it up in the hotel room and it worked perfectly. It also saved us the money of having to rent a crib at the hotel. He likes all the animals on the sides.

       "  'reviewText': 'After our son discovered yet another non-child-friendly item on the floor of our home and hoarded it in his mouth for hours (unbeknownst to us), my wife and I decided we wanted another prison--I mean \"play yard\"--for our son to roam around in because apparently we\\'re terrible at the whole concept of baby-proofing.So I found this item on Amazon and, through my sleeplessness, thought the dimensions were 9\\' x 9\\'--sounded like a steal for $90.  We ordered this one and I was a bit dismayed when the box showed up and it turned out to be another pack n\\' play.  Like probably most other parents, we already have the obligatory pack n\\' play.  It\\'s small and cozy and our son likes it fine.  I told my wife and she was more than a bit dismayed: another pack n\\' play she did not want.  (She also wondered how I thought the dimensions were 9\\' by 9\\', but that\\'s another story.)Well, we could have returned it with the free returns, but after we got it set up and plopped our son it in, we were hooked and so was he.  Here\\'s why it\\'s ten times better than your average pack n\\' play:1.  The colors are so vibrant--reds, blue, green, yellow--as opposed to the muted colors you often see on a pack n\\' play.2.  Each wall of the pack n\\' play has a different feature: for instance, one wall has a ladybug that squeaks; another has a butterfly that moves and rustles; another has a bee that also moves and rustles; and another has a sun with a mirror on it.  Although the mirror is not the fanciest mirror I\\'ve ever seen, it keeps our budding narcissist fascinated for minutes at a time.3.  It\\'s sturdier than any pack n\\' play I\\'ve seen, and the walls don\\'t budge when he stands up in it, but it\\'s also squishy enough to withstand falls.  I\\'ve seen my son fall plenty of times inside of it, and he hasn\\'t seemed bothered.  Perhaps he caught his reflection on the way down.4.  Though not 9\\' x 9\\', it\\'s bigger than any pack n\\' play I\\'ve ever seen.  (Note: I\\'ve heard this can cause problems if you\\'re using it for sleep, because it can be harder to find sheets that fit, though apparently you can find people who make special square sheets instead of the standard rectangular sheets.)5.  Our son actually likes going in there, unlike his other pack n\\' play (or--god forbid--his North States Superyard play yard--you\\'d think we\\'d sent him to Guantanamo Bay).Overall, it really just looks like a fun, happy, and bright place to be in, and it\\'s well made and looks like it will last for a while, and perhaps most importantly, our son doesn\\'t fuss when we put him in there, and, to state the obvious, putting him in there keeps him away from the unmentionable hazards on the floors of our home.  So although I don\\'t think you need TWO pack n\\' plays, I\\'m not too sad that I made the reading error and ordered this one by mistake, because this particular pack n\\' play is awesome.To sum it up, if you\\'re going to buy one pack \\'n play, buy this one, because it\\'s the clear winner.',\n",

My son is primarily breastfed, but my wife and I supplement his breastfeedings with pumped breastmilk and with formula.  The Original Nursers are made from polypropylene, which is a BPA-free plastic.  The liners are also BPA-free although I'm not sure what kind of plastic they are manufactured from.  Unlike some other corporations in the baby products industry, Playtex Baby is serious about customer support.  I have called the customer service number several times now and have gotten to talk to a knowledgeable person in every instance.  If you want to experiment with these bottles to see if they will work for you, I would suggest that you stop in at Target or Walmart.  They sell trial bottles for under $4 that come with either a latex or silicone nipple and 5 drop-in liners.  Unfortunately, the trial bottles that come with silicone nipples are the premium nursers, which are made from polycarbonate, a non-BPA-free plastic (this isn't necessarily a deal breaker for me because the milk never comes into contact with the polycarbonate).\",\n",

I pumped my milk so dad could feed her when I was at work or college.  NEVER had any problem between bottlefeeding and breastfeeding - no nipple confusion, etc.  Gas wasn't a big problem either. They are so easy to clean - no scrubbing the bottle just drop in liners. Just have to clean the base/nipple/ring, but super easy and used to throw in the dishwasher.  Easy to store breastmilk in liners or bags and just pop them in the bottle after thawing. After 7 years could have still used my same bottles but opted to buy new ones because they were not BPA free.I also bought some AVENT bottles this time around - because that is the brand of pump I bought - and they are pretty good too. But these Playtex bottles are my go to bottle as they are SOOOO easy to clean and that is very important when you have a young, hungry, crying baby to take care of! :)\",\n",

However, I did not realize (being a new mom) that this was a sample kit with various nipples (one of each) for older and newer babies, teething babies, nipples that helped encourage latching of the breast and nipples that just plain resembled the breast.I actually would recommend that if you're a first time mom, register for this box and also pick out (seperately) two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow silicone' nipples for younger babies and two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow rubber' nipples for younger babies.First test the silicone on your little one and if your baby does not like it, does not latch on well or has a problem with silicone, try her on the rubber nipples.  After that, you'll know which nipples your baby will need and can purchase more *nipples* to go with the rest of the bottles in your kit.I would suggest you do not use the nipples that come with the kit at all... new babies should either be on silicone or rubber slow-flow nipples for younger babies.  Once you've found the typle of material he/she prefers - stick with it.  And around the age of 4-6 months, switch them to older baby nipples in that same material.Hope this review helps you!  Good luck with your little one.  :)\",\n",

It's especially nice when you're out and about or a long trip and cannot necessarily wash a bottle after use.  What's nice about this starter kit is that it comes with 5 different nipples of varying flows and types (latex and silicone) that I was able to try without having to purchase separately (this is good because of my complaint below).I also like the Playtex one step storage system that you can use with these bottles (refer to my review on Playtex one step storage kits: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSCK6EN7AYRA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm).  With the pump adapter that comes in the storage kits, you can pump directly into the liners.I do have a few complaints about these bottles, though:!) As I mentioned, it's nice that it came with all the different nipples because finding the best one to use with my baby was a chore and a half (refer to my reviews on the Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow latex, Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow silicone, and Playtex NaturaLatch Orthodontic Medium Flow).2) The clear liners make it difficult to see the exact amount that is in the liner if you are pumping directly into the liner, but you learn to estimate more or less.  When you're breastfeeding you have no clue the exact amount the baby is getting anyways.  If you're really anal, just pump into a regular bottle and transfer to drop-in liner.3) Although convenient, the disposable liners do create a lot of waste.
