You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country’s course. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. —President Obama We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. Our journey is not complete until all our children know that they are cared for, and cherished, and always safe from harm. Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity. Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law. Our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts. We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths—that all of us are created equal—is the star that guides us still. We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. —President Obama We, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. We are made for this moment, and we will seize it—so long as we seize it together. —President Obama A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. —President Obama Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people. —President Obama We have always understood that when times change, so must we. —President Obama Barack Obama has been sworn in for a second term as President of the United States. #fourmoreyears I\\'m honored and grateful that we have a chance to finish what we started.

Add your name in support of a responsible budget: http://OFA.BO/M9H. When we sacrifice our commitment to education, we’re sacrificing our future. We can’t let that happen. Our kids deserve better. We need to come together around a budget that sacrifices wasteful spending without sacrificing job-creating investments. http://OFA.BO/pQA1J In Miami today to talk about how we can win the future through education.

Our government has an obligation to make sure that America is the best place on Earth to do business. http://OFA.BO/upVpat Making buildings more energy-efficient is one of the fastest, cheapest ways to save money, combat pollution & create jobs.  http://OFA.BO/pD I send my best wishes for peace, prosperity, and good health to all who celebrate the Lunar New Year across the U.S. and around the world. We can win the future—by unleashing the talent and ingenuity of businesses and workers in every corner of this country. http://OFA.BO/Knsf5a It is because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong. #SOTU From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. That’s how we win the future. #SOTU Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love. #SOTU This July, we will begin to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. #SOTU We shouldn’t just give our people a government that’s more affordable. We should give them a gov\\'t that’s more competent & efficient. #SOTU Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government that does the same. #SOTU Instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let’s fix what needs fixing and move forward. #SOTU I’m not willing to go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a pre-existing condition. #SOTU I’m asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the tax code. Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. #SOTU We need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information—from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet. #SOTU I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. #SOTU If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child—become a teacher. #SOTU If we want to win the future—if we want innovation to produce jobs in America—then we also have to win the race to educate our kids. #SOTU Tonight I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: by 2035, 80% of America’s electricity will come from clean energy sources. #SOTU Instead of subsidizing yesterday’s energy, let’s invest in tomorrow’s. #SOTU This is our generation’s Sputnik moment. #SOTU What we can do—what America does better than anyone—is spark the creativity and imagination of our people. #SOTU We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. We have to make America the best place to do business. #SOTU The future is ours to win. But to get there, we can’t just stand still. #SOTU The world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn’t discourage us. It should challenge us. #SOTU Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans’ paychecks are a little bigger today. #SOTU We measure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer. #SOTU Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known...the economy is growing again. #SOTU We will move forward together, or not at all—for the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than politics. #SOTU About to address the nation on the state of our union.

Make your voice heard: http://OFA.BO/B1mGKz.

Those are the ideals we upheld today. #DADT By ending “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” no longer will patriotic Americans be asked to live a lie in order to serve the country they love. Despite today\\'s disappointing Senate vote, my administration will not give up on the DREAM Act, or on fixing our broken immigration system. I applaud the House for passing, with bipartisan support, the #DADT Repeal Act of 2010. Deeply saddened by the passing of Richard Holbrooke, a true giant of foreign policy who has made America stronger, safer and more respected. On behalf of Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and Bo, have a very merry Christmas. http://OFA.BO/EJ7hbg It was my honor to sign the #DADT Repeal Act of 2010 into law: http://OFA.BO/eyC2TD.

More than 14,000 members of the military have been discharged as a result of #DADT. Two share their stories: http://OFA.BO/x2aLVr. Disappointed that yet another filibuster has prevented moving forward with the National Defense Authorization Act and #DADT repeal. My administration will continue to do everything we can to move forward on immigration reform; yesterday’s DREAM vote is an important step. Why this compromise is the right thing to do: http://OFA.BO/e7veLW. Our country has benefited from the voice Elizabeth Edwards gave to the cause of building a society that lifts up all those left behind. Jews have lit Hanukkah candles as symbols of resilience in times of peace and in times of persecution. Their light inspires us to hope. It’s my hope that together we can move closer to the day when we eliminate HIV/AIDS from the face of the earth. http://OFA.BO/1PY7d7 If you agree that passing the DREAM Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this bill: http://OFA.BO/d4rX7M. Send a message to the Senate that you support the repeal of \"Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell\": http://OFA.BO/xm5osU. It is fundamental to America’s national security that the Senate to approve the New START treaty this year.  http://OFA.BO/ML64vA Send a message that you support giving students and service men and women a path to citizenship through the DREAM Act: http://OFA.BO/kAu5MU. 8 ways to follow the White House: @whitehouse, @lacasablanca, @PressSec, @billburton44, @petesouza, @macon44, @whitehouseostp, @OpenGov #FF As GM relaunches itself as a public company, we\\'re beginning to see some of the tough decisions that we made in the midst of crisis pay off. Deeply disappointed that Republican senators have prevented the Paycheck Fairness Act from being brought up for a debate and a vote. In these challenging days, we can’t afford earmarks—items inserted into spending bills without adequate review. http://OFA.BO/89us57 A special edition of West Wing Week from Asia: http://OFA.BO/M5gHgM I want our veterans to know: We remember. We remember your courage. We remember your sacrifice. And the legacy of your service lives on. It’s time for Democrats and Republicans to focus on our shared responsibilities to work together and deliver results: http://OFA.BO/WU8Tq4. We’ve got to keep fighting for every job, for every new business, for every opportunity to get this economy moving. http://OFA.BO/A7hz2k Don’t ever believe that you can’t make a difference.

Vote like it\\'s 2008! http://OFA.BO/RU I\\'m committed. Are you? http://OFA.BO/RU? Fixing what is broken in our education system will not be easy. We won’t see results overnight—but that’s no reason not to get started. “This was never just about putting a president in the White House. It was about building a movement for change that endures.” Don’t let anyone tell you that this fight isn\\'t worth it. Don\\'t let them tell you that you\\'re not making a difference. \"We see an America where the middle class is growing...where the only limit to success is how hard you\\'re willing to try.\" Republicans have promised to roll back health reform so that insurance companies can go back to denying you coverage when you get sick.

I need you to talk to friends, neighbors, co-workers, aunts, uncles, and tell them—Nov 2 matters.\" \"The question is whether hope once again overcomes fear. The other side is trying to ride fear all the way to the ballot box on November 2.\" \"Our destiny is written by us. When we join together for a common cause, there is nothing we can\\'t do.\" http://OFA.BO/MCib6T By investing in our infrastructure, we will create good middle-class jobs right now—and make our economy run better over the long haul. \"If everyone who fought so hard for change in 2008 shows up to vote in 2010, I am absolutely confident that we will win.\" \"If the other side wins, they’ll try their hardest to give free rein back to insurance companies, credit card companies & Wall St. banks.\" \"As long as I’m President, we\\'re not going to let Washington politicians sacrifice your education for a tax cut we can’t afford.\" \"It’s up to you to show the pundits that you care too much about this country to let it fall backward.\" \"On November 2, I need you as fired up as you were in 2008.\" You can have a direct effect on whether folks vote this November. Can you call 10 voters today? http://OFA.BO/3a55p2 Nothing would be more detrimental to our prospects for economic success than cutting back on education. http://OFA.BO/FVYeih We need to fight the millions of dollars in special-interest funding with millions of voices who are ready to finish what we started. Americans deserve to know who\\'s trying to sway their elections—we can\\'t allow special interests to silence anyone who stands up to them. Let’s show Washington one more time that change doesn’t come from the top. Change happens because of you. http://j.mp/9waeGK The simplest thing you can do before the November elections is also one of the most effective: calling voters from home http://OFA.BO/GrEZ6Y I want to make sure that our legacy to young women is an America where they can fulfill every last bit of their promise. http://j.mp/92ELKK Voter registration deadlines are coming up.

Commit to vote: http://j.mp/9qIFPF I want to thank all @TheDemocrats who worked so hard to get the Small Business Jobs Act passed. Small Business Jobs Act will cut taxes and make more loans available for small business. It’s a great victory for America’s entrepreneurs. The new GOP agenda isn\\'t a prescription for a better future. It’s an echo of a disastrous decade we can’t afford to relive. http://OFA.BO/wk The small-business jobs bill passed today will provide loans and cut taxes for millions of small businesses without adding to our deficit. The United States will do our part—we will be a global leader in international development in the 21st century. Our history as @TheDemocrats is the history of change that matters for America. http://j.mp/aC2vpa Each time we’ve made epic change, it\\'s come from the grassroots rallying around a cause. That\\'s what we need again. http://j.mp/d0aYah It’s up to all of us to defend that most basic American principle of a government of, by, and for the people. http://j.mp/cfDbnQ Elizabeth Warren understands what I strongly believe—that a strong, growing economy begins with a strong and thriving middle class. Our nation’s success depends on strengthening America’s role as the world’s engine of discovery and innovation. http://j.mp/b4cLhQ We are not about to allow a corporate takeover of our democracy. http://j.mp/ddUHxy Announcing the expansion of the Educate to Innovate initiative live from the White House.

Part of moving forward is returning to values that built this country—responsibility for ourselves and for one another. http://j.mp/cNpOWw I don’t believe we can have a strong and growing economy without a strong and growing middle class. Michelle and I wish all who celebrate Rosh Hashanah a sweet year full of health and prosperity. Announcing a plan to modernize America’s roads, rails, and runways—creating jobs now and making our economy better over the long haul.

On Labor Day we honor the American worker and reaffirm our commitment to the great American middle class. http://j.mp/a3RjbF We can’t afford to go backward to the failed policies of the past. We have to move forward. Commit to vote this November. http://j.mp/cQ5kd7 The Iraqi people will have a strong partner in the United States. Our combat mission is ending, but our commitment to Iraq’s future is not. America’s men and women in uniform have served with courage and resolve. I am proud of their service and awed by their sacrifice. There were patriots who supported this war and who opposed it. We are united in appreciation for our troops and our hope for Iraq’s future. I made a pledge to the American people as a candidate for this office—and tonight the American combat mission in Iraq has ended. Addressing the nation from the Oval Office about the end of the war in Iraq. Watch live at 8pm ET. http://wh.gov/live I ask Senate Republicans to drop their blockade of a jobs bill that would cut taxes and make more loans available for small businesses. As we mark the end of America’s combat mission in Iraq, a grateful nation pays tribute to all who have served there. http://j.mp/9Yowhz The people of the Gulf Coast have demonstrated what it means to persevere in the face of tragedy—and rebuild in the face of ruin. Thank you to all the men and women who have served in Iraq. Your dedication, bravery and courage have made America safer. http://j.mp/d0BqjP To keep moving America forward, we need supporters to knock on doors and talk to voters. Join a canvass this weekend: http://j.mp/cd-K. The CARD Act will put a stop to deceptive practices and hold credit card companies accountable to their customers: http://j.mp/aWtnRo.

Please commit to vote: http://j.mp/a5rq5o. This nation has always been proud of what it builds, and that spirit will lead our recovery forward. Don’t lose faith in American industry. We can’t stand by while pink slips are given to those who educate our children or keep our communities safe. http://j.mp/c3gCbH Joining teachers in the Rose Garden to urge the House to pass aid that will save 160,000 teacher jobs. Watch http://wh.gov/live at 11:40 ET. At every juncture in history, we’ve recognized that the way to move forward, in our own lives and as a nation, is to put education first. A minority in the Senate is blocking a vote on a jobs bill for small businesses, and that\\'s a shame. It\\'s time to move forward. The steps we took this year to reform the health care system have put Medicare on a sounder financial footing. http://j.mp/aWL1AD Thank you to all those who signed my birthday card. I was overwhelmed by the kind words I received from everyone. http://j.mp/9X6Z6w Pleased that the Senate has confirmed Elena Kagan as our 112th Supreme Ct. justice. I am confident she will make an outstanding justice. To the naysayers in Washington who said walk away from the auto industry, my message to them is this: Don’t bet against the American worker. We are going to rebuild this economy stronger than before, and at the heart of it are going to be three powerful words: \"Made in America.\" Today Congress took an important step toward ensuring that teachers stay in the classroom and cash-strapped states get the relief they need.
